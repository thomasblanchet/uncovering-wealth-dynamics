                CODEBOOK FOR 2019 SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     NOTE: This file contains about 50,000 lines of text, 
     including this introduction, variable descriptions and 
     other material.  Many users will probably NOT want to 
     print the entire document.  Generally, we recommend 
     working with the material in a text editor using a 
     non-proportional font (e.g., courier) for display.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The codebook serves as the principal guide to the variables
included on the final public version (September 2020 version) of the
2019 SCF data set.  However, not every variable included in this
codebook is actually in the public use data set.  For example,
the data set does NOT include most variables related to the sample
design, details of geography, or the 3-digit industry and occupation
codes.  Although we have attempted to mark the variables in the
codebook that are not available to the public, there may be errors and
omissions.  The definitive list of the variables included is given at
the end of this file.  Please consult that list to determine whether a
given variable is available to you.

The SCF is sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System in cooperation with the Statistics of Income Division of the
Internal Revenue Service.  Data for the 2019 SCF were collected by
NORC, a social science research center at the University of Chicago.

www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2020/pdf/scf20.pdf. Results users 
may obtain from using this release of the 2019 SCF data may differ from 
those reported in this article for several reasons. First, a small number 
of the analysis weights used in that article may have been altered somewhat 
to provide robust estimates of the detailed categories shown.  In brief, 
the data were examined for extreme outliers, and where a given case was 
overly influential in determining an outcome, the weight was trimmed and 
other weights were inflated to maintain a constant population.  Second, 
as noted below, the public version of the data has been systematically 
altered to minimize the likelihood that unusual individual cases could be 
identified.  Our analysis of the public data set suggests that these 
changes should not alter the conclusions of reasonable analyses of the 
data.  Finally, over time we correct errors that we find in the data set.  
In our past experience, the effects of such errors on the estimates have 
been quite small.

This codebook is intended to provide only an overview of the most
critical technical elements of the survey.  For more details, see

questions were asked during the interview.  For an outline of the
questions asked in the survey, see "Questionnaire Outline" at

An attempt has been made to provide as much information as possible
about the text available to the interviewer and the constraints
imposed on the data entry.

documentation for the 2019 SCF is provided on the project website 
(www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTIONNAIRE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 SCF data were collected using computer-assisted personal
interviewing (CAPI).  Thus, there is no questionnaire in the usual
sense.  This codebook serves as the most comprehensive guide to the
definitions of variables included in the survey.  A copy of the
computer SPSS MR Interview code that was used in data collection is
provided on the project website; that program is the authoritative
reference for questions relating to question ordering and skip
sequences.  Near the end of this file, a concordance is given of the
variable names used in the MR Interview computer program and those
used in this codebook.  Although there is usually a direct
correspondence between these variables, there are some places where
the connections are indirect: In some cases, the same question is
asked in two difference places, and in the final data set all instances
of answers to the question are mapped into a single location; in other
cases variables may be inferred from other information (for example,
if a respondent reported a wage on a current job and reported that
their employer contributed a certain percent of their wage to a
pension plan, then the dollar contribution to the plan would be filled
in).  Almost always, the data rearrangements can be identified from
the shadow variables associated with the variables (see section
"VARIABLE NAMES" below).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNIT OF ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the data in the survey are intended to represent the financial
characteristics of a subset of the household unit referred to as the
"primary economic unit" (PEU).  In brief, the PEU consists of an
economically dominant single individual or couple (married or living
as partners) in a household and all other individuals in the household
who are financially interdependent with that individual or couple.  For
example, in the case of a household composed of a married couple who
own their home, a minor child, a dependent adult child, and a
financially independent parent of one of the members of the couple,
the PEU would be the couple and the two children.  Summary information
is collected at the end of the interview for all household members who
are not included in the PEU.  The only variables collected separately
for the respondent and the spouse or partner of the respondent are
those concerning employment, pension, and demographic characteristics.
The great majority of the time, the PEU and the household are identical.

Throughout the codebook, we refer to the "reference person."  The
use of this term is euphemistic and merely reflects the systematic way
in which the data set has been organized.  The reference person is taken 
to be the single core individual in a PEU without a core couple; in a PEU 
with a central couple, the reference person is taken to be either the male 
in a mixed-sex couple or the older individual in the case of a same-sex
couple.  No judgment about the internal organization of the households
is implied by this organization of the data.  When the original
respondent was someone other than the person determined to be the reference 
person in this sense, all data (including response codes) for the two 
members of the couple were systematically swapped. The variable X8000
indicates which cases have been subjected to such rearrangement.

NOTE: Because only limited information is collected on the
ownership of assets and liabilities within the PEU, it is not
possible, in general, to make direct separate estimates of the
financial characteristics of the individuals in the survey
households unless one is prepared to make a number of fairly complex
assumptions.  To understand this point more thoroughly, there is no
substitute for a careful reading of the actual survey questions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLE DESIGN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SCF is based on a dual-frame sample design.  One set of the survey
cases was selected from a standard multi-stage area-probability
design.  This part of the sample, which contributed 4,291 cases to the
final set of interviews, is intended to provide good coverage of
characteristics, such as home ownership, that are broadly distributed
in the population.  The other set of the survey cases was selected as
a list sample from statistical records (the Individual Research Tax File)
derived from tax data by the Statistics of Income Division of the
Internal Revenue Service (SOI).  These records were made available
under strict rules governing confidentiality, the rights of potential
respondents to refuse participation in the survey, and the types of
information that can be made available.  This second sample was
designed to disproportionately select families that were likely to be
relatively wealthy (see Bricker, Jesse, Alice Henriques, and Kevin 
Moore (2017) "Updates to the Sampling of Wealthy Families in the 
Survey of Consumer Finances," Finance and Economics Discussion Series 
2017-114. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.) 
(https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017114pap.pdf)
for a more extended discussion of the design of the list sample).  The
list sample contributed 1,492 cases to the final set of interviews.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For many purposes it is useful to know which responses to categorical
questions were available to the interviewer and which of them were
provided, in principle, to the respondent.  Responses that are noted
in the codeframes below by an asterisk are ones that were available to
the interviewer on the screen during the interview.  In general, if a
response is given in the codebook in lower case letters, this
indicates that it was permissible for the interviewer to read it to
the respondent.  Responses listed in all upper case letters are ones
that were not intended to be read to the respondent.  Codes that
result from the recoding of responses originally reported as "other"
are also given in lower case letters.  Other subsidiary question texts
given in capital letters are intended as interviewer instructions.

In some cases, codes were available conditional on responses to
earlier questions.  One such example that appears throughout the
interview is the reporting of institutions where the respondent has
accounts of some type.  If the respondent reported fewer than seven
financial institution at X305, every time the interviewer came to a
question that asked about the institution where the respondent had an
account, the screen displayed the names of the already listed
institutions (referred to as "Institution 1" etc. in the codebook), a
code for "add an institution," and a code to enter to record an
unusual type of institution ("a person or other non-institution"). Once 
seven institutions had been recorded (either at X305 or by adding
institutions later in the interview), the screen displayed the names
of the seven institutions, the "a person or other non-institution" field,
and a set of codes for the type of institution (i.e., commercial bank,
savings and loan or savings bank, credit union, etc.).

For many questions there are multiple versions.  Most commonly, there
are variants that are appropriate for single individuals and ones
appropriate for families of two or more.  Some other variants are more
complicated.  For example, suppose that a respondent lives in a
building with multiple housing units (X702=1), the family owns the
entire building (X714=1), and they own the unit they live in
separately from the rest of the building.  The CAPI program stores the
information that there is such a property.  Later in the interview
when the respondent is asked about the number of investment real
estate and vacation properties, one variant of question X1701 reminds
the respondent to include the property mentioned earlier.  There are
many other such instances where the computer alters questions to
suit the previous answers given by the respondent, and this codebook
attempts to provide at least a summary form of all the possible
questions.  For example, at X1711 (correspondingly at X1811), the 
respondent is asked whether there are any outstanding
loans on a property.  If the respondent had previously reported at
X1703 (correspondingly at X1803) that the property was a
time-share, then the variant for time-shares is asked; otherwise a
more generic question is asked.

Telephone interviewing has long been important in the SCF.  For the
2019 survey, the data indicate that 36 percent of all the interviews
were completed by telephone.  At the beginning of the interview, the
interviewer entered a response to X7578 to indicate whether the
respondent had available a set of cards listing the possible responses
to several questions.  Although interviewers attempted to make the
cards available in as many cases as possible, sometime that was not
feasible.  When the answer to X7579 recorded that the cards were not
available, the CAPI program would change the text to display the text on
the card for the interviewer to read to the respondent.  Throughout
the codebook, such alternative versions of questions have been flagged.

For the 2019 SCF, about 200 area-probability interviews were conducted 
via a mixed mode strategy of web and in-person or telephone interviews.  
These cases were a test of the feasibility of offering the web as a 
potential mode for completing the SCF.  Potential respondents were 
provided a personalized link to obtain access to the sections of the 
survey to complete via the web, with a follow-up in-person or telephone 
interview to complete the remainder of the interview.  The questions for 
the web portion were nearly identical to those asked in the regular 
in-person or telephone interview, aside from formatting changes necessary 
for the web instrument.

Of the 5,783 interviews, 3 percent were conducted in Spanish.  The Spanish
text is not provided in the main section of the codebook, but the
interested user may consult the MR Interview program on the project
website at the location mentioned above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLE NAMES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The codebook refers to the variables by the names they have in the
version of the survey data set formatted for use with SAS.  These names
consist of a number prefixed by an "X."  We have tried, insofar as it
was possible, to retain the variable numbering system used in earlier
SCFs.  Where the content of a variable has changed in a substantive
way, we have assigned a new variable number.

Each of the variables in the main data set has a "shadow" variable that
describes--in most all cases--the original state of the variable
(i.e., whether it was missing for some reason, a range response was
given, etc.).  The most important exception is reported values which
have been imputed or otherwise altered to protect the privacy of
respondents (see "DISCLOSURE REVIEW" below).  Users who so desire may
use the shadow variables to restore the data to something very close
to their original condition. The shadow variables have the same
numbers as the main variable, but have a prefix of "J."  A list of the
values taken by the shadow variables is given in the section below
entitled "DISCUSSION OF RANGE DATA COLLECTION AND J-CODES."

The 2019 questionnaire had few changes from the 2016 version.
A new hypothetical financial emergency option was added, where
respondents could indicate that they would work more or get
another job in times of financial stress. More education 
loan mop-up questions were added to indicate whose education 
had been paid for with the loans.   

The following is a list of changes in the final 2019 data set.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL DATA CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout the SCF data set, a value of zero has only one meaning: that
the item in question is inapplicable.  That is, if a family does not
have a checking account, then the number of checking accounts they own
would be coded as a zero.  Whenever zero is a legitimate response to a
question, a value of -1 is used to signify that value.  Other
specialized codes are defined for specific variables in the codebook.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE ID NUMBERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the original case numbering system (XX1 and ALT_XX1), important
aspects of the sample design are apparent from the identification
numbers.  Because such information is not releasable under the
agreements which allow us to collect the data, each case included in
the public version of the data set has been given a random
identification number (YY1).  Users should note that it is not
possible to know with certainty from the information provided in the
public version of this data set which cases derive from the list
sample.  The record ID numbers (X1 and Y1) correspond to the case ID
number times 10, plus the number of the implicate (imputation
replicate--see below).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"OTHER" CODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In almost every case where a respondent could supply a response that
did not fit in the codeframe offered to interviewers on their computer
screens, the CAPI program was constructed to allow the entry of a
verbatim response.  There were a few open-ended questions that were
set up to accept only a verbatim response.  All of these verbatim
responses were run through a standard coding process at the FRB.  
Any responses that remain coded "other" in the final data set are very
unusual, but legitimate responses which do not fit within the existing
codeframe; because these responses appeared unlikely to reoccur in future
surveys, the codeframe would not be not augmented.  Responses that
were not informative (or were not answers to the questions that were
asked) were treated as missing values and were imputed.  A similar
process has been followed since the 1995 SCF.  In earlier surveys, the
information recorded for "other" responses was not as complete, and
consequently the efforts to recode the available verbatim data were
somewhat less stringent.  Thus, analysts should exercise caution in
time series comparisons of "other" responses from the 1995 and later
surveys with those in earlier years.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRIDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some sets of questions in the SCF have a natural iterative pattern.
For example, the survey asks for detailed information on up to the
first six checking accounts owned by the PEU, and summary information is
collected about all remaining accounts.  The detailed questions are
the same for each account.  In past interviews done with paper and
pencil, some respondents resisted answering the detailed questions but
were willing to provide summary information.  Typically, interviewers
recorded the summary information in the margins of the questionnaire,
and editors allocated the data to the skipped questions according to a
set of fixed rules.  To allow for a variety of respondent-interviewer
interactions in the SCF CAPI program, the grid questions were
organized to provide a way of collecting summary information in a
systematic way.  We refer to the associated summary variables as
"mopup variables."  Past surveys also indicated that some respondents
recalled additional instances of items once they began answering
questions in a grid, but interviewers often did not revise the
originally reported number.  The CAPI procedures were set up to allow
for this possibility of recalling additional items.

Consider first a respondent who gives a non-missing response to the
question that asks for the number of items of the type to be queried
in the grid.  The interviewer would ask the respondent the first set
of detailed questions on the item.  Then, the interviewer would be
confronted with a question (not to be read to the respondent);

  INTERVIEWER:  CONTINUE, OR GO TO MOPUP OF LOOP?

The intention of this question was to allow the interviewer to deal
with a potentially hostile respondent and immediately branch to the
mopup questions.  If the respondent was cooperative, the interviewer
entered a CONTINUE response and followed an identical procedure at
each iteration until either the number of items reported was
exhausted, or the maximum number of detailed questions was asked and
the mopup question was asked to get summary information on all 
remaining items.  If the respondent reported a number of items less
than the maximum number about which the detailed questions are asked,
the following question was asked at the end of the final iteration:

  Do you (or your family living here) have another xxxx?

A YES response here indicates that the respondent recalled an
additional instance in the process of answering the detailed
questions.  A respondent could continue to "add" iterations until the
maximum number of iterations is reached and the mopup questions are
asked.

Another possibility is that a respondent initially may either not know
or not be unwilling to tell the number of instances of an item.
Because it is known that there is at least one such instance, the
first set of detailed questions is asked.  Then the respondent is
asked:

  Do you (or your family living here) have another xxxx?

The questioning then proceeds exactly as it would for a respondent
who recalled additional instances after providing an initial number of
instances.

In processing the data, several steps were taken to attribute the data
collected to their correct location.  First, in some cases interviewers
answered the question "INTERVIEWER:  CONTINUE, OR GO TO MOPUP OF LOOP?"
with the latter response, even though only one more instance remained.
In such cases, the mopup data were mapped into the appropriate
position in the grid.  This data movement is not directly recorded in
the J-variables for such cases, although the movement can be deduced
from the patterns of J-variables of other questions within the
iteration of the grid that do not have mopup equivalents: the value
of the J-variables for such variables without mopup equivalents
would normally be 2052.  Second, when respondents added instances, the
originally reported number was updated and stored in the customary SCF
variable number.  The originally reported number of instances has been
retained in the data set since such information cannot be recovered in
any other way from the data made available.  Third, when summary
information was given by respondents who broke off their responses in
a grid prematurely, that information was used to bound the imputations
of the detailed data.  Data items that have an associated J-variable
with a value of 90 are ones where a complete response was given in the
parallel mopup variable, and those with a J-variable of 91 are ones
where a range response was given in the parallel mopup variable.
There are some complicated mixed cases where a respondent gave
a missing value for the number of instances, but was willing to
provide non-missing mopup data.  Though tedious, it is possible to
deduce this information from the J-variables provided.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY VARIABLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary variables (e.g., NET WORTH) are not included in the main
data set.  Although it is complicated to construct such variables, it
is our belief that a substantial amount of judgment is involved in
defining variables, and that other analysts should make their own
decisions.  However, as a convenience to users, we have included on
the SCF web site a program written in the SAS language that was used to
create the variables used in the 2020 Federal Reserve Bulletin article
on the survey and an Excel file containing the summary variables.
Users who wish to use the definitions in this program are encouraged
to review the definitions to be certain that classifications are
appropriate for their analytical purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAPI EDIT CHECKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like earlier SCF CAPI programs, the one constructed for the 2019
survey contained some simple tests of the appropriateness of data
entered.  Most variables have a limit on the acceptable range of the
values that can be entered.  Sometimes a test may block a clearly
illogical response until it is corrected.  Other times it may simply
require the interviewer to confirm that the response entered was
correct.  This codebook contains a specification of all such tests
in the CAPI program.

A new system of data checking was first introduced in the 2007 survey
for a subset of particularly important variables.  If the interviewer
entered an answer to one of those questions that was questionable, the
interviewer was given two options.  First, the interviewer could
choose to clarify or correct the answer with the respondent at that
point and record a comment as appropriate.  Second, if the time
pressure in the interview or the sensitivity of the issue to the
respondent was such that the interviewer could not take time to
explore the answer or explain the situation, the interviewer could
choose to defer explaining the situation until the debriefing for the
case was completed after the interview.  Such a debriefing is
completed for every completed interview.  Throughout the codebook,
such tests are noted under the heading "EDIT CHECK" for the variable
where such tests applied.  Information from the interviewer's
responses to these tests was a key input into the data editing.  In
some instances, the specification of the edit in the codebook differs
somewhat from the one actually applied during the interview;
generally, such differences are small and they reflect errors in
programming the CAPI instrument; any such omissions were enforced at
the editing stage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very large amount of time has been spent in searching for errors in
the data and resolving those errors to the extent possible.  Many
seeming inconsistencies appear in the raw data and appear to have no
obvious reconciliation.  Our initial presumption is always that the
respondent understood each question and reported accurately, and that
the process of transcription and coding did not distort that
information.  In cases where other information led us beyond a
reasonable doubt of the validity of the data, we have changed data,
either by altering values directly or by setting them to missing and
imputing them; in all such cases, the shadow variables indicate that
we have overridden reported data (for an overview of the extent of
data changes, see "Measuring Data Quality In the 1998 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Arthur B. Kennickell, August 1999,
www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scf_workingpapers.htm. For
a briefer, more recent update, see "Hesitant Respondents and Data
Quality on a Financial Survey," Catherine C. Haggerty, Shannon Nelson, 
Richard Windle, August 2017, 
www.federalreserve.gov/econres/files/data_quality_respondent_hesitancy.pdf.
Comments provided by interviewers during the course of the interview
or in the mandatory debriefing completed for each interview are a key
source of information in evaluating the content of the interviews.
We ask our colleagues who use this data set to help us in finding any
remaining resolvable inconsistencies in the data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPUTATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the variables that originally contained a missing value code
have been imputed.  The exceptions include such variables as X6695
(which reports the original number of checking accounts reported by
the survey respondent) and X6504 (which is the interviewer's
description of the property where the respondent lives).  The nature
of any originally missing values may be understood by examining the
J-codes associated with the variables.  A multiple imputation
procedure yielding five values for each missing value is used to
approximate the distribution of the missing data.  The individual
imputation are made by drawing repeatedly from an estimate of the
conditional distribution of the data.

The imputations are stored as five successive replicates
("implicates") of each data record.  Thus, the number of observations
in the full data set (28,915) is five times the actual number of
respondents (5,783) (see DISCLOSURE REVIEW below for information on
the public version of the data set).  The imputation procedure is
described in "Multiple Imputation in the Survey of Consumer Finances"
(Arthur B. Kennickell, September 1998, www.federalreserve.gov/
econresdata/scf/scf_workingpapers.htm).  For a general discussion of
multiple imputation and its uses, see "Multiple Imputation for
Nonresponse in Surveys" by Donald B. Rubin, John Wiley and Sons, 1987.
Multiple imputation offers two distinct advantages compared with
singly-imputed data.  First, because multiple imputation yields
multiple outcomes from a random process, it supports more efficient
estimation than singly-imputed data.  Second, multiple imputation
allows users to make straightforward estimates of the degree of
uncertainty associated with the missing information.

For users who want to estimate only simple statistics such as sums,
means and medians ignoring the effects of imputation error on the
standard errors of these estimates, it will probably be sufficient to
divide the weights by 5.  Software to compute means and medians and
their associated standard errors with respect to imputation and
sampling error is provided in the section on sampling error later in
this codebook.

Users who want to estimate more complex statistics, particularly
regressions, should be cautious in their treatment of the implicates.
Some regression packages will treat each of the five implicates as an
independent observation and correspondingly inflate the reported
statistical significance of results.  Users who want to calculate
regression estimates, but who have no immediate use for proper significance
tests, could either average the dependent and independent values
across the implicates or multiply their standard errors by the square
root of five.  For an easily understandable discussion of multiple
imputation in the SCF from a user's point of view, see Catherine
Montalto and Jaimie Sung, "Multiple Imputation in the 1992 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 7, 1996,
pages 133-146 (http://afcpe.org/assets/pdf/vol7_133-146multipleimputation.pdf).
That article also contains a set of simple SAS macros to
use to compute correct standard errors from multiply imputed data.
Two alternatives for processing general model estimates are offered
here, one written in SAS (MACRO MISECOMP) and the other in a Stata
ado file (micombine).  (NOTE: both SAS and Stata now include regression
packages for the analysis of multiply imputed data.)  See the section
"ANALYSIS WEIGHTS" below for a brief discussion of the inclusion of
sample design effects in the estimation of complex statistics.

The imputations for missing data are subject to hierarchical logical
constraints, but otherwise they reflect the data, whether they be
consistent or inconsistent.  For example, total income (X5729)
in the reported data is sometimes not equal to the sum of the individual
components (X5702 etc.), so this constraint is not automatically
applied to the imputed data.  Variability in the imputations for a
variable in a given case may sometimes be large.  This variation is a
reflection of the fundamental uncertainty about the true value of the
item.

* MACRO MISECOMP computes standard errors corrected for multiple imputation;
* The input may be regression results, or any other results (e.g.,
  probits) that include a point estimate and a standard error estimate
  for each implicate;
* The data sets are named &DSN.1-&DSN&NIMP (where &DSN and &NIMP are
  defined below);
* The form of the input data set is described above;
* Often, it is quite easy to copy output directly from a statistical
  procedure into the form of this program without deleting extraneous
  information;
* The required input variables are VARN (a name of the statistic of
  interest in all NIMP data sets), B1-B&NIMP (a working name for the
  point estimate of interest for each implicate--where the terminal
  number corresponds to the terminal number of the input data set), and
  S1-S&NIMP (a working name for the standard error of the point
  estimate in each implicate--where the terminal number corresponds to
  the terminal number of the input data set;
* The parameters of the MACRO are:
  NIMP: number of implicates (default is 5)
  DSN: first part of name of each of the NIMP input data sets (e.g.,
  DSN11, DSN12,...,DSN15 could be results for implicates 1-5 for model
  1) (default is DSN1i, where "i" ranges from 1 to NIMP)
  PRNTPR: determines the number of digits of the output data (default
  is SAS format 10.6);
* The output includes three lines for each unique VARN in the
  input data sets: the final point estimate, the final standard error,
  and the final t-statistic;

******************************************************************************;

* Steps to compute standard errors;
* (1) run each model (regressions, probits, etc.) for each of the five
  implicates separately;
* (2) copy the model outputs into program code as described above;
/*
  For example,
  DATA DSNij;
    INPUT VARN $ Bi Si;
    CARDS;
    data here
    ;
  RUN;
  where "i" ranges over the number of distinct models treated, and "j"
  ranges over the number of implicates.
  NOTE: any technique that reads VARN, Bi and Si into the data sets will
  work.
*/
* (3) call MISECOMP (MACRO defaults will work correctly for the SCF if
  the data set names are DSN11, DSN12, DSN13, DSN14, DSN15);

For Stata users, the easiest way to correct your coefficients and
standard errors for various estimation models is to use the Stata
micombine ado file.  This ado file was created by Patrick Royston and can
be downloaded at http://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s446602.html.
When using micombine with the SCF data, users need to create a
variable that denotes the implicate of the data.  The implicate
variable is used in the impid() option and the Y1 case id variable is
used in the obsid() option in micombine.  An example is below.

DISCUSSION OF RANGE DATA COLLECTION AND J-CODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the 1995 SCF, the CAPI program has allowed interviewers a
variety of ways to enter partial information on dollar amounts (for a
detailed description and analysis of range data in the 1995 survey,
see "Using Range Techniques with CAPI in the 1995 Survey of Consumer
Finances," Arthur B. Kennickell, January 1997, www.federalreserve.gov/
econresdata/scf/scf_workingpapers.htm.  In the past, we had evidence
that some  respondents volunteered figures in ranges.  Good
interviewers have always tried to get respondents to settle on a
single "best" figure, but sometimes it may be that there is no firm
figure (e.g., the value of a privately-held business may be known only
at the point it is actually sold) and probing too far could cause the
respondent to answer "don't know" or to refuse to answer.  The CAPI
program allows respondents to report a range of possible value in such
cases.  There is another class of respondents who may not volunteer a
range, who do not know (or will not give) an exact figure, but who
will give some information about the value.  To obtain information
from this second group of people, the CAPI program includes two
options.  First, a respondent who is uncomfortable actually saying an
amount may report a letter from a card that specifies a number of
ranges.  The range card has been used very successfully in earlier
waves of the SCF, but CAPI allows the option to be presented
consistently.  Second, a respondent who declines the use of the range
card is asked a series of questions in a "decision tree" that are
designed to specify a range.  The dollar breaks in the decision tree
vary by question (so that, for example, monthly rent is not subject to
the same ranges as the value of corporate stock).  The computer
sequences used for range follow-up for all dollar values in the survey
(known as "DollarProbe") are outlined schematically in a section
below.

It should be noted that interviewers were strongly instructed
that a single dollar value is the best answer to each of these
questions.  Although there is the distinct possibility that
respondents may become "trained" in the use of the range questions
during the course of the interview (the effect of this training is
unclear at present: respondents may tend to report "too many" ranges
because they know that they are allowed; alternatively, respondents
may learn that it is much quicker to give a single dollar figure),
interviewers should be using all of the standard techniques to get
respondents to give a single figure where possible.  Evidence from the
SCF suggests that this approach dramatically reduces the frequency of
"don't know" responses, but it has little effect on refusals.
Although the overall proportion of respondents reporting no
information is much lower, generally the proportion providing
apparently complete responses declined.

Schematic diagram of the sequence used for all dollar questions:

                 Qnn.  How much is your [******]?

level 1:  $________  Volunteer a range     Don't know        Refuse
                                               |________________|

                     or dollar range?

                     RC      DR            RC      DR         NO/DK     Refuse

level 3:  OUT        Letter  Upper bound   Letter/Own range   Decision
                             Lower bound                      tree

level 4:             Confirm Confirm       Letter  Own        Confirm   Confirm

level 5:             OUT     OUT           Confirm Confirm    OUT       OUT

level 6:                                   OUT     OUT

(OUT=proceed to next question)

At the first level, the respondent has the option of providing a
dollar amount (interviewers were strongly urged to obtain a single
dollar value where possible), volunteering a range, answering "don't
know," or refusing to answer.  These responses require a variety of
different follow-up questions.  In the case of a single dollar
figure, the CAPI program displays in words the number the interviewer
has typed into the computer and proceeds to the next question.  If the
respondent volunteers a range, there is an option to report either a
range in dollars (in some cases the upper or lower bound of a
range may be missing--e.g., as in the case where a respondent answers
"greater than a million dollars") or to give a letter from a range
card (the ranges are given below).  If the respondent answers "don't
know" or refuses to answer, the program will request a range; if
the respondent agrees, the program will accept the same types of
range that may be volunteered directly from the initial dollar
screen.  If the respondent is unable to provide a range in this way
(that is the respondent answers "no" or "don't know"), the program
presents a series of questions known as a "decision tree," which is
specified in greater detail below.  If the respondent refuses at any
point beyond the initial dollar screen or answers "don't know" at any
point after entering the decision tree, the program proceeds to the
confirmation screen.  The exact question text for this sequence is
given below.

For some of the range options, it was not possible for the interviewer
to note directly that a value was negative.  Where it was necessary to
record a negative range and could not be accommodated directly, the
interviewer was instructed to operate on the absolute value of the
amount and to make a comment explaining to the data editor that the
range referred to a negative amount.

If R volunteers a range at level 1, the following is displayed at
level 2:

     SELECT TYPE OF RANGE:

     ENTER LETTER FROM RANGE CARD
     R WILL GIVE RANGE

  If the range card option is chosen, the screen displays:

     ENTER LETTER FROM RANGE CARD:

  and any of the following letters on the range card may be entered:

               A    ......    $1 - $100
               B    ......    $101 - $500
               C    ......    $501 - $1,000
               D    ......    $1,001 - $2,500
               E    ......    $2,501 - $5,000
               F    ......    $5,001 - $7,500
               G    ......    $7,501 - $10,000
               H    ......    $10,001 - $25,000
               I    ......    $25,001 - $50,000
               J    ......    $50,001 - $75,000
               K    ......    $75,001 - $100,000
               L    ......    $100,001 - $250,000
               M    ......    $250,001 - $500,000
               N    ......    $500,001 - $1 million
               O    ......    $1 million - $5 million
               P    ......    $5 million - $10 million
               Q    ......    $10 million - $25 million
               R    ......    $25 million - $50 million
               S    ......    $50 million - $100 million
               T    ......    More than $100 million


  If R offers to give a dollar range, the screen displays:

     ENTER LOW END OF RANGE :  $___,___,___.__

     ENTER HIGH END OF RANGE : $___,___,___.__

  Whichever type of range is selected, after the range information is
  entered, the program skips to the confirmation screen.

If R answers "don't know" or "refuse" at level 1, the following text
is presented:

     IF IN-PERSON READ:
     Can you give me a range--either your own range or one from the
     range card?

     IF TELEPHONE:
     Can you give me a range?

     YES, OWN RANGE
     YES, RANGE CARD
     NO

  If one of the YES options is chosen, the sequence is as given above
  for directly volunteered ranges.

  If R refuses at this point, the program skips directly to the
  confirmation screen.

  If R answers "no/don't know", level three is a decision tree
  designed to guide the R into a range response where possible.

    In the decision tree, respondents are asked a series of questions
    to bound the true response within an interval.  The intervals are
    defined in terms of seven values; let those values be denoted
    generically by V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7.  The questions asked
    take the following form:

     Q1.  Was it more than V4 dollars, less than V4 dollars, or about
          V4 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q2
               LESS --> GO TO Q5
               SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q2.  Was it more than V5 dollars, less than V5 dollars, or about
          V5 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q3
               LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q3.  Was it more than V6 dollars, less than V6 dollars, or about
          V6 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q4
               LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q4.  Was it more than V7 dollars, less than V7 dollars, or about
          V7 dollars?

               MORE, LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q5.  Was it more than V1 dollars, less than V1 dollars, or about
          V1 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q6
               LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q6.  Was it more than V2 dollars, less than V2 dollars, or about
          V2 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q7
               LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q7.  Was it more than V3 dollars, less than V3 dollars, or about
          V3 dollars?

               MORE, LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN


    To allow for appropriate ranges for all dollar questions, there are
    eight different versions of the V1 to V7 variables given below.

Version     V1     V2       V3       V4         V5         V6          V7
   1     50,000  100,000  250,000  500,000    1,000,000  5,000,000   10,000,000
   2     10      25       50       100        200        300         500
   3     25,000  100,000  150,000  250,000    500,000    1,000,000   5,000,000
   4     10,000  25,000   50,000   100,000    250,000    500,000     1,000,000
   5     5,000   10,000   25,000   50,000     100,000    250,000     750,000
   6     500     1,000    5,000    10,000     25,000     75,000      250,000
   7     100     250      500      1,000      2,000      10,000      50,000
   8     50      100      250      500        1,000      5,000       10,000
   9     1,000   5,000    10,000   25,000     50,000     100,000     250,000

    There are 22 possible unique outcomes of each version of each of the 8
    versions of the decision tree:

    1. Q1=LESS, Q5=LESS
    2. Q1=LESS, Q5=DK

    21. Q1=Ref ---> NOTE: RESULTS IN NO BOUNDING INFORMATION
    22. Q1=DK ---> NOTE: RESULTS IN NO BOUNDING INFORMATION

    If R answers "don't know" or "refuse" at any point in the decision
    tree, the program skips to the confirmation screen.

The confirmation screen:

  Where the R has given a complete dollar response the confirmation
  screen displays:

    I would like to confirm that that amount is... (amount in words)

  Where the R has given a letter from the range card, the confirmation
  screen displays:

    I would like to confirm that is range card letter (letter).

  Where the R enters and completes any questions in the decision tree,
  the confirmation screen displays"
    I would like to confirm that the amount is in a range around...
    (midpoint of a fully bounded range or the endpoint of an
    open-ended range)

  Where the R refuses or answers "don't know" in a way that no range
  information at all is obtained, the confirmation screen indicates to
  the interviewer that no information has been obtained.  Nothing
  on the confirmation screen is read to the R in this case.

  The data entry on the confirmation screen offers the following two
  options:

    THIS IS CORRECT
    GO BACK AND FIX


*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;

The shadow variables fall into three large groups.  Codes of less than
90 indicate that data were not originally missing (or that they could
be inferred with high confidence from other information).  Codes
with an integer value from 90 through 1096 indicate that the respondent
provided a type of range response.  The extensive form of the paths through
the range questions encompasses a large number of outcomes, as is
reflected in the number of possible range codes.  For the codes that
indicate a range response, there may also be a decimal component.  A
code with a decimal part equal to 0.5 indicates that the initial
response that the respondent gave to the associated dollar question
was "don't know."  In every other case, there should be no decimal
component to the shadow variable.  Codes of 1097 or more indicate that
the associated data value was completely missing.

There is an important exception to the normal assignment of J-codes.
In some cases, it is not known where a reported value should actually
be reported, because a higher-order question was missing.  For
example, if the respondent does not know if a car loan is a regular
installment loan, by default the CAPI program asks a generic question
about the typical payment on the loan; if the loan is a regular
installment loan, the appropriate question would be about regular
payments; in the initial data processing, the payment amount is
inserted into both potential locations and one of them is set to the
code for inapplicable (zero) after the loan types is imputed.  In such
cases, the original J-code for the reported data is retained in all
relevant locations.  As a quality control mechanism, the imputation
software is set up so that it can never alter an original J-code.

*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
Definitions of the "J" Variables (2019 version)

0  = Originally reported value.  See above for an exception.

1  = Question is inapplicable (e.g., R has no checking account
     so value of checking account is coded as zero.)  NOTE: all
     values of zero in the data set are in some sense inapplicable
     [also see J-code value 14]; reported values of zero are
     typically stored as -1.

2  = Data taken from (or moved from) another location (e.g., a
     motorcycle misclassified in the automobile grid moved to the
     other vehicle grid); data moved from another location and added
     to data already at the new location (e.g., wage income from
     spouse reported in independent adult part of the questionnaire
     added to data reported for R in the section on total family
     income); data reported in a "mopup" field that could be directly
     mapped into the correct final location.  These moves and changes
     may be the result of verbatim responses, interviewer comment, or
     other information.

4  = CAPI program error: resolution yields a non-missing (non-range)
     value.

5  = Indicates a value coded directly by FRB staff from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response or interviewer comments that
     translate directly into a valid response.  This code indicates
     that there was the exercise of a bare minimum of judgment in
     encoding the content of the text data.  ("Super-no" corrections
     are included here.)
6  = Indicates a value coded directly by NORC from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response.

8  = variable computed from other non-missing variables.

9  = variable overridden by logically equivalent information to
     maintain consistency of data (e.g., when type of property is a
     time share (X1703=25), but R says they own the share alone
     (X1704=1)--rather than saying that the property is a time share
     (X1704=5)--then the response to X1704 is changed to 5).

10 = This code applies to variables where part of the original value
     reported should have been (or was also) reported elsewhere and is
     edited out here (e.g., in the case where the wage income of NPEU
     member is reported at X6403 and at X5702 along with income of
     the PEU, the NPEU value is removed from X5702 and J5702=10).

11 = Assumption made in CAPI program to guide questions dependent on
     marital history (applies at X107 only): value originally answered
     "don't know" or "refuse".
12 = Assumption made in CAPI program to guide questions dependent on
     marital history (applies at X107 and X7020 only); except code 11.
     Question not directly asked.

13 = Data change in editing; based on information in interviewer
     comments made during or after the interview, data structures
     elsewhere in the interview, data retrieval from interviewers, or
     mechanical review of data patterns.  Judgment is implied in the
     use of this code.
14 = Inapplicable code generated by any data adjustment,
     (particularly adjustments associated with J-codes 2, 4, 10, 13, 15,
     16, and 17).
15 = Non-stochastic imputation of missing data (typically based at
     least in part on other, non-codeable data).
17 = Value of originally missing data item implied by/computed from
     other variable(s).  Relatively more judgment is implied by this
     code than a code 8.

30 = Respondent agreed to provide a dollar range as a response
     (either as a directly volunteered range or in response to the
     question soliciting a range after an initial response or "don't
     know" or "refuse"), but the upper and lower bounds of the range
     given were identical.
31 = Respondent entered the decision tree, but chose one of the
     boundary points of a range as the approximate value.

36 = A "don't know" response was given as an answer other than the
     first one to a code-all-that-apply question where the order of
     the responses is taken to matter.  This response is set to blank
     for purposes of data processing.
37 = A "refuse" response was given as an answer other than the
     first one to a code-all-that-apply question where the order of
     the responses is taken to matter.  This response is set to blank
     for purposes of data processing.

ALL RESPONSES THAT FOLLOW HAVE AT LEAST SOME MISSING INFORMATION

90 = Bounding information available based on summary information
     provided by respondent (typically, if a R does not know
     information about items beyond a certain number in a set of
     detailed questions about a larger number of such items, the R is
     asked one or a number of summary questions about all remaining
     instances).
91 = Same as 90, but R gave range data for the summary information.


RANGE RESPONSES:

POSITIVE RANGES

DECISION TREE RESPONSES THAT RESULTED IN A BOUND FOR POSITIVE NUMBERS

(NOTE: for decision tree codes, responses that resulted in no usable
bounding information are collected separately below)
'*' indicates an open-ended interval

NOTE: for J-code outcomes from 101-978, 1021-1040, and 1071-1090, .5 is
added to the J-code if the original response was DK

OTHER CODES FOR MISSING DATA

2050 = Original response was DK.
2052 = Original response missing as a result of missing information for
     a higher-order question.  For example, if the respondent refused
     to say whether or not the family had a checking account, then the
     number of checking accounts would be missing in this sense.
     In a few circumstances a different procedure is followed: (1) if
     a dollar variable was missing and the answers in DOLLARPROBE
     yielded a missing value that variable has an associated frequency
     question that is only asked when a positive value of the dollar
     variable is reported, then the frequency variable is given the
     same J-code as the dollar variable; (2) for clusters of variables
     containing a dollar amount and percent options (for example,
     employer match rate percentage contribution and dollar amount of
     contribution to a pension plan) that can be computed from each
     other (perhaps given some other variable--in the case of the
     example, this other variable would be the worker's wage).
2053 = Original response was refused
2054 = Original response was "some, DK how many" (see B6).

2056 = Missing value determined from verbatim response by NORC coders.

2060 = Unresolved data problem (none should remain in final data set).

2079 = Data missing because of questionnaire error.
2080 = Recode variable, missing because data not collected for
       sub-group, data to be imputed.
2081 = Recode variable, some, but not all components originally missing.
2082 = Recode variable, all components originally missing.

2097 = Override of reported information with (at least partially)
       imputed data
2098 = Override of reported/inap./other information with a missing value.

2099 = Used for absent spouse for J104 or J105 when X104 or X105 < 0.

3000 = Data missing because R broke off the interview (each of these
       cases reviewed to be sure that sufficient information is
       reported that the case can count as a "partial accepted as
       complete")

3001 = CAPI program error yielding a missing value.

3002 = Temporary value given to variables containing illegal values.
       These will all be resolved in editing and converted to other
       existing codes.  (includes "range U")

3003 = Illegal zero response

3004 = Uninformative/irrelevant verbatim response

3005 = Data not available (applies to data from survey screener)

3500 = Data set to missing and imputed for disclosure avoidance

General instructions for J variable coding for recoded variables:
  When a recoded variable is taken directly from another single
    X-variable, it should have the same J-variable code.
  When a recoded variable may come from a single variable in the
    original X-variables, or as the result of a calculation based on
    some number of X-variables, it is important to distinguish the
    information content in the J-variables.  As noted above, when the
    value is taken directly, the J-variable should have exactly the
    same value as that for the X-variable's shadow J-variable.
    However, when some calculation is involved, this should be
    reflected in the J-variable -- codes 8, 2081, and 2082.
  When a recoded variable cannot be computed because some part of the
  underlying information was not collected for some subset of cases,
  the recoded variable's J-variable should be coded 9 or 2080.

ANALYSIS WEIGHTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the SCF sample is not an equal-probability design, weights
play a critical role in interpreting the survey data.  The main
data set contains the final nonresponse-adjusted sampling weights.
These weights are intended to compensate for unequal probabilities of
selection in the original design and for unit nonresponse (failure to
obtain an interview).  The weight (X42001) is a partially design-based
weight constructed at the Federal Reserve using original selection
probabilities and frame information along with aggregate control
totals estimated from the Current Population Survey.  This weight is a
relatively minor revision of the consistent weight series (X42000)
maintained for the SCFs beginning with 1989 (For a detailed discussion
of these weights, see "Consistent Weight Design for the 1989, 1992,
and 1995 SCFs and the Distribution of Wealth," by Arthur B. Kennickell
and R. Louise Woodburn, Review of Income and Wealth, Series 45, Number
2, June 1999, pp. 193-215 or the longer version given on the SCF web

The nature of the revisions to the consistent weights is described in
"Revisions to the SCF Weighting Methodology: Accounting for
Race/Ethnicity and Homeownership" (Arthur B. Kennickell, January 1999,
www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/ scf/scf_workingpapers.htm).
A version of the revised weight has been computed for all the surveys
beginning with 1989, and this variable has been added to the public
versions of the SCF data sets.  Users should be aware that the
population defined by the weights for *each implicate* (see above) is
128.6 million households: the sum of each of the weights over all
sample cases and imputation replicates is equal to five times the
number of households in the sample universe.

Although the weights should produce reliable results at the level of
broad aggregates (e.g., net worth and income ), it is important to
note that many of the variables collected in the SCF are highly
skewed in their distributions and that many such variables will apply
to only a relatively small fraction of the sample; thus, estimates of
characteristics of such variables may be distorted by outliers.  In the
SCF group at the Federal Reserve, we routinely review our calculations
for the presence of overly-influential outliers, and robust techniques
are applied when appropriate.  We encourage other users to exercise
similar care in analyzing the data.

The issue of weighting in regressions has long been controversial.
Users of the SCF may find two references particularly useful:
(1) Analysis of Complex Surveys, C.J. Skinner, D. Holt, and
T.M.F. Smith (editors), John Wiley and Sons, 1989 (see particularly
pages 8-10, 154-157, and 286-287). (2) The Analysis of Household
Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy, Angus
Deaton, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997 (see particularly pages
67-73).  At the least, users should think carefully about the effects
of weights in their particular models.  Weighted estimates may be
dramatically less efficient than unweighted estimates, particularly in
the SCF.  If one is interested in estimating descriptions of the
population--rather than "structural models"--there are some clear
justifications for weighting and making estimates of sampling error
(see below) to test for statistical significance.  If weights make a
substantial difference in regression estimates, analysts may want to
consider the possibly that their models omit some key structure that
could be controlled for in a way other than weighting.

SAMPLING ERROR
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SCF is a designed as a scientific instrument for the measurement
of behavior.  However, even under ideal operational conditions, the
measurements of the survey are limited in a fundamental way by the
fact that it is based on a sample of respondents rather than the
entire population.  Variability of estimates due to sampling can be
estimated.

Because we are unable to release any of the basic sample information
about the cases in the data set, users are unable on their own to
compute reasonable estimates of the sampling variances of their
estimates using standard packages.  To facilitate such estimation, we
provide a file of replicate weights and multiplicity factors
corresponding to X42001.  Using detailed information about the
original sample design, we  selected 999 sample replicates from the
final set of completed cases in a way intended to capture the
important dimensions of sample variation (for details see "Weighting
design for the 1992 Survey of Consumer Finances," Arthur Kennickell,
Douglas McManus and Louise Woodburn, December 1996, 
www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scf_workingpapers.htm
For each survey case and each replicate, the file contains a weight
(WT1B1-WT1B999) and the number of times the case was selected in the
replicate (MM1-MM999).  We computed weights for each replicate using
exactly the same procedures we used for the main weights.  Replicate
weights were computed only for the first implicate of each case.  For
many purposes, users of the replicate weight files will probably want
to multiply the weight times the multiplicity: in all cases the sum of
each of the weights times the corresponding multiplicities of the
cases equals the total number of households.  To estimate the sampling
variance of the mean of family income, for example, a user would
estimate the mean 999 times using the replicate weights and compute
the standard error of that estimate.  An estimate of the total
standard error attributable to imputation and sampling is given by
SQRT((6/5)*imputation variance + sampling variance).

A simple SAS program to compute the standard error due to sampling and
imputation for the mean and median of a given variable is provided
below.  This program may be adapted easily for other types of
calculations.  For example, to compute the standard error of a
proportion, create a zero/one dummy variable to indicate the presence
of the item; the standard error of the mean will be the correct
standard error of the proportion.  To reduce the computer memory
requirement, the program computes sampling error using blocks of 100
replicate weights rather than the full set at once.  Users with large
amounts of RAM may wish to increase the size of these blocks, and
those with smaller amounts may wish to decrease the size.

      one wishes to compute the standard error due to imputation and

      of the full survey data where the population total varies

    * NOTE: the calculation excludes observations with missing values

      might be to set all such values (normally zero in the main SCF
      database) to a missing value (a WHERE condition would also
      work).  The program assumes that missing value patterns are
      consistent across implicates--if this is not the case, a WHERE
      condition should be used;
    * WARNING: if one uses this MACRO to compute variances for very
      small sub-populations, there is a chance that some of the
      replicates may contain no cases where the condition defining the
      sub-population holds.  In this case, the program will return a
      fatal error;

DISCLOSURE REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables not included in the public data set are available only to
members of the Microeconomic Surveys Statistical Unit at the Federal
Reserve Board.  Not even other researchers at the Federal Reserve
Board are allowed access to the non-public data.  There is no
provision whatsoever for allowing direct access to such information
for external researchers.  Occasionally, when a researcher outside of
the SCF project staff has a topic that complements the research
interest of the Federal Reserve Board and when there has been time for
the project staff to engage with the researcher, the project staff
have made limited runs against the internal data of computer programs
that have been specified and fully tested by external researchers.  A
special case must be made for each such instance.  THERE IS NO ROUTINE
PROVISION FOR ACCESS TO THE RESTRICTED SCF DATA.

A paramount goal of the survey is to protect the privacy of the
participants, who generously shared their personal information.
In light of this goal, the data in this release have been 
systematically altered by several means to minimize the possibility of
identifying any survey respondent.  For some discrete variables, small
or unusual cells were collapsed as noted in the individual variable
descriptions below with the descriptions of the variables.  Continuous
variables were rounded.  Data were also blurred by other means
intentionally not specified.  In addition, a number of other cases
were identified for more extensive treatment.  Some of these cases
were selected on the basis of extreme or unusual data values; other
cases were selected at random.  For each of these cases, a selection
of critical variables was set to missing and statistically imputed
subject to constraints designed to ensure that any distortions induced
in key population statistics would be minimal.  Where relevant, the
codebook provides more detailed information on cell collapsing and
other techniques.

By design, the SCF sample excludes people who are included in the
Forbes Magazine list of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. (see
references in "SAMPLE DESIGN" above).  However, there are several
reasons why respondents with wealth at this level could appear in the
sample anyway.  In the 2019 survey, there were 6 observations that
had net worth at least equal to the minimum level needed to qualify
for the Forbes list.  Because it would be very difficult to obscure
sufficiently the identity of such people without rendering their data
virtually useless, it was decided to remove them from the public
version of the data set.  Thus, the public version of the data set
contains 5,777 of the 5,783 observations in the full data set.

It is important to note that aside from the cell collapsing, there is
no key in this codebook or in the data set that would allow users to
identify with certainty either which data items have been smoothed or
otherwise altered, or which cases were selected for imputation of
critical values (that is, the shadow variables in this data set may not
always reflect the true original status of every variable).  Although
this blurring of the data will have some effect on analysis, that
effect should be negligible in most cases.  For further details
on the procedures taken to protect the identity of respondents, see
"Analyzing the Disclosure Review Procedures for the 1995 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Gerhard Fries, Barry W. Johnson, and R. Louise
Woodburn, September 1997, www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/
scf_workingpapers.htm) and "Multiple Imputation and Disclosure
Protection: The Case of the 1995 SCF" (Arthur B. Kennickell, November
1997, www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scf_workingpapers.htm).
The disclosure protections applied to the data are the product of an
agreement between the Federal Reserve Board, NORC, and SOI.  Users who
feel that the restrictions imposed on the public data set are too
constraining are encouraged to submit written proposals for expanded
data release, and those requests will be given serious consideration
in the release of data from future surveys.

Note that dollar variables in the public data set have been rounded
according to the following scheme which preserves the population mean

COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, medians of financial characteristics estimated from the
SCF should compare well with medians estimated from other surveys
using comparable population definitions.  However, estimates of means
will often differ, largely for two reasons.  First, means of many
financial characteristics may not be very robustly estimated in
surveys that interview only a relatively small number of wealthy
households.  The distribution of many financial characteristics (e.g.,
net worth) is highly skewed, and sparse representation of the upper
tail will translate into a noisy estimate of statistics, such as the
mean, that are strongly affected by the top of the distribution.
Second, there may also be a degree of bias in the measurement of some
financial characteristics.  Evidence suggests that there is
differentially higher nonresponse among wealthy households.  Failure
to account for such differences in the creation of analysis weights
leads to a misrepresentation of the size of the upper tail of wealth
and characteristics associated with being in that tail.  By using frame
data for the list sample, the SCF has the means to identify and make
some corrections for such nonresponse.  However, this option is not
available in most other surveys.

The SCF may also be compared with aggregate statistics, such as the
Financial Accounts of the United States, which are constructed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Income
and Product Accounts (NIPA), which are constructed by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA), and data published by the Statistics of
Income (SOI) division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  An
analysis of the differences between the SCF and these sources is
provided in "Comparing Micro and Macro Sources for Household  Accounts
in the United States: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances",

Jeffrey Thompson, Federal Reserve Board, June 2015, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015086pap.pdf
As discussed in that paper in detail, there are many conceptual
differences between the SCF and the aggregate data that researchers
should keep in mind when comparing the data sources.

The SCF is a large project that involves intense commitment by many
people.  At the Federal Reserve, the main project staff involved with
the creation of the data included Neil Bhutta, Kathy Bi, Jackie Blair, 
Jesse Bricker, Andrew Chang, Lisa Dettling, Sarena Goodman, Julia Hewitt,
Joanne Hsu, Kevin Moore, Sarah Reber, Dalton Ruh, Alice Henriques Volz, 
and Richard Windle. Important support has come from the current 
FRB officer corps, particularly Karen Pence and Michael Palumbo, and from 
the Director of the Division of Research and Statistics, Stacey Tevlin. 
John Sabelhaus provided invaluable guidance and support during his tenure 
as section chief and line officer for MEcS.

Support from the Statistics of Income Division (SOI) at the IRS has
been essential.  Barry Johnson, director of SOI, and David Paris
have been essential in negotiating  access to the SOI data needed for the
SCF sample design.  Barry Johnson also has been tireless in his work to
facilitate the relationship between the Federal Reserve and SOI and
well as in consulting on the disclosure review for the SCF and in
sharing the insights he has gained in working with the IRS estate tax
data.  Michael Parisi was particularly helpful in reviewing the 
confidentiality protecting procedures used in creating the public 
version of the SCF data.

At NORC, very many people have touched the project in important ways. 
Catherine Haggerty was the Project Director and her Deputy was Micah 
Sjoblom. Chet Bowie served as the NORC corporate liaison to the SCF.  
Steven Pedlow led the statistical team; Katie Archambeau led the data 
delivery task; and Becki Curtis created the client Sample Control File. 
Lisa Lee and Michael Stern designed the web test.  A large number of 
people in the NORC central office helped with preparation of materials, 
training and various parts of the survey management; these people 
include Kate Bachtell, Nella Coleman, Hans Erickson, Jonathan Hootman, 
Ann Kang, Colton Kochanek, Rachel Miller, Shannon Nelson, Amy Obendorf, 
Heather Sawyer, Camille Smith, Karen Veldman, and many others. Amy 
Bartolini was the budget monitor for the project. Edward Sipulski managed 
the mailing and receipt operations and he was assisted by Arvey Basa and 
Amanda Johanson; the mail clerk supervisors included: Lindsay Appelman, 
Abesh Aziz, Belinda Castillo, Roberto Chong, and Keith Johnson  

Lili Bergquist managed the IT team.  Geoff Walker, Ben Heitkotter, Ryan 
Kennedy, Ming Yang, Chris Payne, Jeremy Talbot, Nikolay Berg, Sneha Praveen, 
and Farhan Ahmed provided many critical elements of Case Management system 
development.  Val Cooke and Taifoor Beg were the CAPI programmers. Other 
key IT support was provided by Jennifer Mazanec, Ben Heitkotter, Paul Silver, 
Serena Sampson, Rebeca Corona, Fred Abram, Tomella Young, Wesley Kennedy, 
Richard Duda, Eric Jensen, and Richard Martinez. Logistical support was 
provided by Lynda Branden.  

Field operations are the heart of survey research, and a very large share 
of the credit for the success of the project goes to the people involved 
in that area.  Juan Mendizabal was the NORC Central Office representative 
who coordinated field operations. Ella Kemp supervised the Field Project 
Managers Pamela Ulbrich, Sherry Smiddy, and Vivian Howard.  Suzanne Bard was 
our communications liaison. Wendy Wilson provided oversight for our pretest. 
Special locating support and list sample management was provided by Nina 
Walker, Wendy Wilson and Amy Silver. Frankie Duda and Theresa Creighton 
provided field technical support. The Field Managers were Deborah Waters, 
Mamta Malhotra, Debra Cipriano, Veretta Padilla, Angela Banner, Tina Gavin, 
Constance Lael, Jayne Garcia, Eileen Mink, Lindsay Crozier and Diane Wolfort.

The interviewers for the main field work, some of whom may prefer not to be 
named, are always the people who perform the hardest work. In 2019, the field 
team included many experienced interviewers--some who had worked on earlier 
SCFs--and others from a wide variety of backgrounds. They deserve the deep 
gratitude of users of the SCF data.  We humbly apologize to any other colleagues 
in the Central Office or the field who worked on the 2019 SCF whose names do not 
appear here through our oversight.  

The largest debt is always owed to the survey respondents, who are
necessarily anonymous.  May every user of the data remember that some
person gave his or her time in the public interest to create the data
that make their analysis possible. 

No set of acknowledgments would be complete without mentioning five
people: Arthur Kennickell, who spent the majority of his career at the
Federal Reserve Board building and evolving the SCF in so many
aspects that continue to be a part of the survey; Gerhard Fries, 
who worked with such dedication and committment to the ideal of 
producing the highest quality data;  Fritz Scheuren, who provided 
early and continuing encouragement, insights, and support for the 
SCF project; Robert Avery, the director of the first SCF, who not only
created the atmosphere that made the current development of the
project possible, but who continues to contribute as a sounding board
for our ideas; and Dorothy S. Projector, the project director of the
Federal Reserve's landmark 1962-63 Survey of Financial Characteristics
of Consumers, set a very high standard for all future work on
household wealth surveys.

It is likely that some users will have trouble understanding the
organization of the data at first.  IF AFTER HAVING FRAMED A FOCUSED
QUESTION AND EXHAUSTED ALL OF YOUR LOCAL RESOURCES, YOUR PROBLEM
PERSISTS, you may contact the project staff at
RSMA-SCF-PublicFeedback@frb.gov.  While we would like to be helpful to
you, please realize that WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO
PROVIDE EXTENSIVE SERVICES TO USERS.  We hope that by persistence, you
will almost always be able to figure out what you need by consulting
the questionnaire and the codebook below. We should be your very last
resort.  Users should feel free to report data errors at any time.

X42000          Original Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight.


X42001          Revised Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight: accounts for
                systemative deviations from CPS estimates of homeownership
                by racial/ethnic Groups.  This weight should be used for all
                estimations using the final 2019 SCF data for which weights
                are appropriate.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPLICATE WEIGHTS AND MULTIPLICITY FACTORS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the introduction, there is one additional data file
which contains replicate weights and multiplicity factors to be used in
estimating sampling variances.  The file corresponds to the main
weight X42001.

The replicate weights are of the form WT1Bi, where i=1,...999
The multiplicity factors are of the form MMi, where i=1,...999

Replicate weights with a given index correspond to multiplicity
factors with the same index.

                THIS STATEMENT MUST BE READ TO ALL RESPONDENTS:

                This interview is completely voluntary and confidential,
                and all the information collected will be used for
                statistical purposes only.  Because this interview is a
                part of the Survey of Consumer Finances, I will be asking a
                number of questions that have dollar answers.  The most
                useful answer is always an exact amount that truly reflects
                your situation.  However, this is not always possible--you
                may not know the figure, or you may not feel comfortable
                answering.  Because your answers are so important to the
                study, you may provide rounded amounts or dollar ranges
                instead of exact amounts.  Of course, if there is a
                question you cannot answer or do not want to answer, we
                will move on at that point.  Feel free to consult any
                knowledgeable person or use any records and notes at any
                time during this interview.  And please ask questions
                when anything is not clear.

                IN PERSON:
                HAND THE INSTITUTIONS CARD TO THE RESPONDENT AND SAY:  As
                we go through the interview, I will ask you to write a few
                things on this card to help keep us on track.  At the end
                of the interview, I will either leave this card with you or
                tear it up, whichever you prefer.

                ON THE PHONE:
                As we go through the interview, I will ask you to write down 
                the names of institutions with which you do business.  This 
                will help us to keep on track.  At the end of the interview, 
                feel free to discard this list as you wish.

                     1.     Reversed
                     5.     Not reversed

                In the 2019 SCF, the definitions used in determining
                whether a spouse or partner is a part of the primary
                economic unit changed somewhat from earlier SCFs.  Most of
                these changes affect small groups of the population.  Two
                groups account for most of the changes.  First, cases where
                the respondent initially reports being married, but the
                spouse is not there (or it is questionable whether the
                spouse is there) and does not share in the finances of the
                unit (or it is questionable whether the spouse does so).
                The second group is a roughly comparable group of partners.
                Where respondents have not been willing to answer questions
                about the presence of spouses or partner, default
                assumptions were made.

X7019           The following variable summarizes the sets of possible marital
                arrangements and specifies the assumption about whether a
                spouse or partner is included in the primary economic unit.
                The information used in this classification is based on the
                answers of the original respondent; when X8000=5, this
                information is contained in the first position of the
                household listing variables below, and when X8000=1 the
                information in the second position was used.
                Note that unlike the case with other variables in the main
                interview, variables in the initial household listing
                describing the respondent's marital status are not imputed.

                IN THE CAPI PROGRAM USED IN THE SURVEY, DESIGNATED R's
                WERE FIRST ASKED THEIR DATE OF BIRTH (X5907/X7003/X5908 OR
                X6107/X7382/X6108 DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF X8000).
                THE COMPUTER CALCULATED THEIR AGE AND THEN THE INTERVIEWER
                ASKED FOR CONFIRMATION (X7005/X7015).  AT THAT POINT, A
                RESPONDENT COULD AGREE TO THE COMPUTED AGE, CORRECT THEIR
                BIRTH DATE, OR PROVIDE A DIFFERENT AGE (X8022/X104).  FOR
                THE DESIGNATED R, THIS VARIABLE CONTAINS THE DOB AGE UNLESS
                A DIFFERENT AGE WAS REPORTED SUBSEQUENTLY.  FOR THE R'S
                SPOUSE/PARTNER, ONLY AGE WAS ASKED DURING THE HOUSEHOLD
                LISTING AND DATE OF BIRTH WAS ASKED LATER IN THE

                terms while others don't. 
                                
                On a scale from zero to ten, where zero is no
                searching and ten is a great deal of searching, what number would you 
                (and your {husband/wife/partner}) be on the scale?

                time you borrowed?

                feel about credit.  In general, do you think it is a good
                idea or a bad idea for people to buy things by borrowing

X8300           Inferred number of institutions.  When institutions were
                reported (or in some cases, imputed) after the institution
                data were collected (except in the case of bank-type credit
                cards) the CAPI program returned to the institution
                questions for the added institutions.  In some cases,
                interviewers failed to enter the new institution properly,
                so the followup questions were not generated by the CAPI
                program.  X8300 takes the originally reported value of X305
                as its base and adds additional institutions whenever a
                commercial bank, savings and loan, credit union, or
                brokerage was reported without an initial link to the
                institution data.  Where there were more than the 6

                the total number of institutions was augmented and stored
                in X8300.  In cases where any of the first seven institutions
                have been inferred from an interviewer error, the detailed
                information (location and how R does business) has been

                set up to augment the list of institutions until the
                respondent said there were no more.

                If X305 contained a value that indicated that there were
                accounts, but the number was a missing value, the R was
                asked:

                NOTE: CARD 5 was available to the interviewer.  This card
                contains the following in a vertical column: "Commercial
                Bank," "Savings and Loan or Savings Bank," "Credit Union,"
                "Finance or Loan Company," "Brokerage," and "Other."

                NOTE: Throughout the codebook, there are variable which
                are labeled "Recode: type of institution".  In these
                locations, the preceding question asks the respondent
                whether the institution where a loan/account is held is
                the same as one of the ones originally recorded in the
                sequence here.  If it was one of these, the interviewer
                entered a link to the appropriate institution.  If it was a
                new institution and there were fewer than seven institutions
                already listed, the interviewer was instructed to follow a
                procedure to add the institution to the existing list of
                institutions.  Once seven institutions were recorded in the
                list, the interviewer could either link to an institution
                that had already been recorded or code an institution type
                (e.g., commercial bank).  For the cases where a link was
                made to one of the listed institutions, the recode
                variable contains a code for the institution type obtained
                from matching to the sequence of variables described here.
                Where the institution was one that was outside the scope of
                the list, the recode variable contains a code for the
                institution type as asked directly from the respondent.

                NOTE: Examination of the data suggests that a relatively
                small number of respondents reported that their mortgage
                institution was a finance company and some others reported
                that it was a brokerage.  Examination of the name of the
                institution, which is available for most cases in a
                non-public internal data set, suggests that the respondent
                misclassified a mortgage company or mortgage broker.

                Now I have some questions about the types of cards that people 
                have for making payments or accessing financial accounts.

X7594           A reloadable prepaid debit card is not linked to a bank or credit union 
                account, but you or someone else, like a relative, or a 
                government agency, can add money onto this card.  You can use it 
                to make purchases and pay bills where credit cards are accepted. 
                
                Do you (or anyone in your family living here) have any prepaid debit cards?

X701            Now I have some questions about your home.
                
                Do you (and your family living here) own this (house and
                lot/apartment/ranch/farm), do you pay rent, do you own it as a
                part of a condo, co-op, townhouse association, or something
                else?
                
                IF THE PROPERTY IS OWNED THROUGH A TRUST THE
                PEU SET UP, TREAT IT AS OWNED BY THEM.

                NPEU IN THIS HOUSEHOLD:
                IF OWNERSHIP IS SHARED WITH NPEU, CODE "OWNS ONLY
                PART".
                IF NPEU OWNS ALL, CODE "Neither owns nor rents" OR
                "Pays rent".

                *********************************************************
                CRITICAL VARIABLE: If the home ownership is answered
                "don't know" or "refuse," the following text appears in
                CAPI:
                
                ATTENTION:
                Homeownership is a critical detail in family finances.
                Without this information, it would be wasting your time to
                go on with the interview.
                
                I will terminate the interview at this point and I would
                like to thank you for your time.
                
                   TERMINATE INTERVIEW
                   GO BACK AND CHANGE OWNERSHIP

                When we talk about the value of (farm/ranch) assets and
                liabilities here, we are referring to (farm/ranch)

                Now I'd like to ask you some questions about your (family's)
                attitudes about saving and planning for the future.

                People have different reasons for saving, even though they may
                not be saving all the time. What are your most important
                reasons for saving?
     
                IF R SAYS THEY DON'T/CAN'T SAVE ASK:  If you were saving now,
                what would be the most important reason you would have to save?
     
                PROBE:  What else?
     
                TREAT 'SAVING' AND 'INVESTING' THE SAME.

X3501           Now I'd like to ask about different types of financial
                assets that you might have.  First, do you (or anyone in
                your family living here) have any checking accounts at
                any type of institution?
                
                IF YES:  Please do not include any money market accounts
                unless you use them regularly as checking accounts.

                DO NOT INCLUDE BUSINESS ACCOUNTS.
                DO NOT INCLUDE LOAN ACCOUNTS OR CREDIT CARDS WITH

                     5.    *NO


X3502           Have you (or anyone in your family living here) ever had a
                checking account?

                     1.    *YES
                     5.    *NO

X3503           IN PERSON VERSION:
                (SHOW CARD 18)  
                Looking at this list, please tell me which is the most
                important reason (you don't have/your family doesn't have)
                a checking account.
                
                READ RESPONSES IF NECESSARY.
                
                TELEPHONE VERSION:
                Please tell me which is the most important reason 
                (you don't have/your family doesn't have) a checking
                account.  Is it...

                     1.    *Because you don't write enough checks to make
                            it worthwhile
                     2.    *Because the minimum balance is too high
                     3.    *Because you do not like dealing with banks
                     4.    *Because service charges are too high
                     5.    *Because no bank has convenient hours or location
                    12.     Checkbook has been/could be lost/stolen
                    13.     Haven't gotten around to it
                    14.     R has other account with checking privileges
                            (money market account, managed investment

                    15.     R not allowed to have account (e.g., asset test
                            for welfare)
                    16.     Someone else writes checks for R or manages
                            R's finances
                    20.     R does not need/want a checking account, n.e.c.
                    21.     Credit problems; bankruptcy; R does not meet
                            depository's qualifications for having an account
                    22.     Concern about overdraft fees
                    95.     Don't have (enough) money
                    -1.     Can't manage/balance a checking account

IRA/KEOGH ACCOUNTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

X3601           As we continue through the interview, I will be asking you 
                about several types of retirement assets you may have, such 
                as IRAs, annuities, and pensions and retirement accounts you
                may have through a current or past job.
                
                Here I would like to ask just about IRAs and Keogh
                accounts.  These may include accounts that you 'rolled
                over' into an IRA after leaving a previous job as well as
                Roth IRAs, or any other type of IRA or Keogh account that
                is not part of a retirement plan on a current or past job.

                Do you (or anyone in your family living here) have any
                Keoghs or IRAs?
                
                IF YES, SAY: Please do not include IRA-SEP or IRA-SIMPLE
                accounts, which we treat as job pensions.
                
                "EDUCATION IRAs" ARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

                     1.    *YES
                     5.    *NO

                IRA or Keogh accounts?

If R reported that R/SP/OFM had an IRA (X3602=1/X3612=1/X3622=1) , but
answered DK/REF to type, the CAPI program asked the balance in all of
the accounts.  As in the cases where R broke off before completing a
grid, this total amount was used as a constraint in the imputation of
the individual components.

                insurance?  Please include individual and group policies,
                but not accident insurance.

X4002           The two major types of life insurance are term and
                cash-value policies.  Term policies pay a benefit if the
                insured person dies, but otherwise have no value.  They are
                often provided through an employer or union, but may also
                be bought by individuals.  Cash-value policies also pay a
                death benefit, but differ in that they build up a value as
                premiums are paid.
                  
                Are any of your (family's) policies term insurance?

If R reported having life insurance (X4001=1), but reports no term
insurance (X4002=5) and no whole life insurance (X4004=5), then the
CAPI program asked R the total face value of all types of life
insurance.  R might also have reported having term insurance, DK
whether other insurance is whole life but still know the face value or
the remaining insurance.  If an amount was provided, it was used as a
constraint on the imputation of the sum of the face value of term and
cash value life insurance.

                For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
                for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
                constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
                MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
                (1 = working fewer than 20 hours per week), a dummy variable
                for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
                (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
                of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
                an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
                than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
                3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
                a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
                level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
                coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
                cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
                these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
                [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
                if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
                occupation.

                For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
                for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
                constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
                MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
                (1 = working 20 or fewer hours per week), a dummy variable
                for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
                (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
                of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
                an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
                than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
                3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
                a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
                level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
                coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
                cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
                these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
                [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
                if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
                occupation.

X5729           What would be the correct total?
                
                How much was the total income you (and your family living here)
                received in 2018 from all sources, before taxes and other
                deductions were made?
                
                IF R SAYS TOTAL IS ZERO, ASK WHETHER THERE WAS A LOSS
                OR IF THE AMOUNT IS ACTUALLY ZERO.

                ANNUAL $ AMOUNT IN 2018:
                    -1.     Nothing
                    -9.     Negative (public data set only)
                *********************************************************
                    ORIGINALLY ALLOWED VALUES: [-999999999,...,999999999]
                *********************************************************
                    FOR THE PUBLIC DATA SET, NEGATIVE VALUES ARE SET TO -9
                *********************************************************

                NOTE: if X7361=1, the computed total is held in X5729.
                NOTE: in the public version of the data set, the X7361 may
                be YES, but the value of the income in X5729 may not be
                equal to X5702+X5704+X5706+X5708+X5710+X5712+X5714+X5716+
                X5718+X5720+X5722+X5724 because of various operations
                applied to the data for disclosure avoidance.  The details
                of this operation cannot be revealed, but a general
                description of the process is available in the papers cited
                in the introduction to this codebook.

X7650           Is this income unusually high or low compared to what you
                would expect in a "normal" year, or is it normal?

                     1.    *High
                     2.    *Low
                     3.    *Normal

                NOTE: some respondents reported that their 2018 income was
                unusually high (low), but gave a normal income figure at
                X7362 that was higher (lower).  These cases appear to be
                ones where the frame of reference for "normal" has shifted:
                e.g., a student made an unusually large amount last year as
                a student, but in a full-time job now makes more.


                Why is that?

                have the opportunity to comment on the interview.  The 
                information you provide in this section is a critical element
                in producing the highest quality data possible.

                The first part of the section repeats all [Alt-C] comments 
                you made during the main interview and allows you to review
                them and add to them as necessary.

                The second part will present any edit screens that you may
                have deferred dealing with during the main interview.  Please
                provide the best explanation you can of the situation
                described.

                The last part is a series of questions addressed to you about
                how the interview went.  Remember, no one else will ever have
                the perspective you have on this case right now.  Please be
                sure to share as much of that as possible in your answers.

MAPPING FROM MR INTERVIEW VARIABLES ("Q-variables") TO SCF VARIABLES
("X-variables)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section provides a rough guide for the equivalence of SCF and
MR Interview variables included in the original data set.  The SCF
variables included in the mapping may deviate from those in the
codebook for several reasons.  First, some MR Interview variables with
idential content have been collapsed into one SCF variable.  Second,
some information has been rearranged to conform to the treatment of
data in the SCF since 1989.  Third, some recode variables computed
from the basic variables are included in the main final data set.
Variables from the main data set and the interviewer debriefing are
listed separately below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN SURVEY INSTRUMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This list includes the variables associated with the DollarProbe
subroutine and variables corresponding to a set of edit checks that
allow for extensive additional input from the interviewer or the
respondent (see the introduction to this codebook).  The variables in
each row are: the relative order of the variable in the sequence, the
SCF variable name (where one is assigned), the MR Interview variable
name, a numeric/character variable indicator, a flag indicating
whether the variable was an extended verbatim response, and the
variable label.
