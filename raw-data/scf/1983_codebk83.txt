SURVEY DESCRIPTION AND OVERVIEW INTRODUCTION
     There have been many changes in financial markets during the last
decade.  Inflation and interest rates increased sharply in the late
1970s and then fell after recessions in 1980 and 1981-82.  Major
financial innovations occurred, such as the introduction of money
market funds, and the regulation of financial markets altered
dramatically after enactment of the Depository Institutions
Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980.  To assess the effects
of these changes on the financial position of households, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Treasury,
Office of Tax Analysis joined together to sponsor the 1983 Survey of
Consumer Finances (SCF).  The 1983 SCF collected data on the assets
and liabilities of a nationally representative sample of
U.S. households.  The survey was designed to provide detailed
information on the characteristics of different types of assets or
liabilities and on the institutional sources of these balance sheet
items.  Data on reasons for various financial choices and attitudes
toward financial risk, liquidity, and credit use were also collected
to help explain household behavior.  In addition, the 1983 survey
provides information that permits estimation of pension and Social
Security wealth.  Such information is not generally available from
other data sources.
     Interviewing for the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances was
conducted by the Survey Research Center (SRC) of the University of
Michigan between February and August of 1983.[1]  The survey sample
consists of 3,824 randomly selected U.S. households and a supplemental
sample of 438 high- income households drawn from federal income tax
files.  The supplemental high-income  sample provides better
representation of the upper tail of the wealth distribution than that
provided by most other surveys.  In conjunction with the household
survey, a survey was conducted with the pension providers of those
households reporting pension coverage.  The Pension Provider Survey
collected the formulas for computing pension benefits for 75 percent
of applicable households with pensions (1,421 households).  In the
Summer of 1986, 2,822 of the 1983 SCF respondents were found and
administered a limited telephone reinterview, offering the opportunity
to study household savings over the intervening three years.
     This manual describes the set of "recoded, edited, and imputed"
variables developed at the Federal Reserve Board.  It documents the
procedures used for editing the raw survey responses, the statistical
methods used for imputing missing data, the construction of new
variables from the original variables, and the addition of new
variables which have been created by matching information from other
data sources.  The manual also presents technical material on the
survey's design and weights.  It should be used in conjunction with an
earlier release of the SRC (dated 7/11/84), which describes the
variables representing the raw responses of the survey respondents.
The interviewers instruction manual, also released by SRC also
provides useful information.  For a summary of some of the basic

DESIGN AND METHODS
     The 1983 SCF sample consists of a randomly selected, nationally
representative, area probability sample of all U.S. households
(cross-section sample) and a supplemental sample of high-income
households drawn from federal income tax files (high-income sample).
The area probability sample used the 1970 SRC National Sample frame.
The sample was designed to represent housing units in the coterminous
United States (the 48 lower states) exclusive of those on military
reservations, nursing and rest homes, college dorms, jails, hotels,
missions, convents, monasteries, and other institutional quarters.[2]
Housing units were selected by a multi-stage procedure that samples
successively smaller geographic areas.  Probability selection was
enforced at all stages of sampling.
     The first stage of the sample selection procedure was that used
to draw the 1970 SRC National Sample.  The 1970 frame was used because
full data from the 1980 Decennial Census were not available at the
time of the survey.  The frame was adjusted, however, to represent
1980 population values.  The 1970 SRC National sample was drawn by
assigning all U.S. metropolitan areas (SMSAs) and non-SMSA counties to
74 relatively homogeneous strata, and selecting one SMSA or county
(primary sampling unit or PSU) per stratum.[3]  Twelve of these strata,
representing New York City and the other 11 largest SMSAs, contained
only one PSU, and thus, were selected with certainty.[4]  From each of
the remaining 62 strata, which contained between 2 and 200 PSUs, one
primary area was selected with a probability proportionate to
population.  Thirty-two of these strata were SMSAs and 30 were strata
made up of non-SMSA counties or county groups.  The sample was
stratified by region of the country, so that each of the four major
geographic regions -- Northeast, North Central, South, and West --
received representation in proportion to their population.  In order
to reduce variances below those that would be obtained with ordinary
stratification, PSUs in each region were selected using a controlled
selection method.  This method controlled the distribution of sample
PSUs by state and degree of urbanization.  It results in a more
geographically balanced sample and increases the precision of sample
estimates relative to a more conventional random design.  The PSUs
selected for the 1983 SCF were drawn from 37 states and the District
of Columbia as shown in figure 1.

                             The SCF Sample
                             (see appendix)


     PSUs were divided into successively smaller sampling units in
subsequent stages: cities, towns, census tracts, minor civil
divisions, and rural areas (second stage);[5] urban blocks and rural
areas containing 16 to 40 housing units (third stage);[6,7] and
individual housing units (fourth stage).[8]  All of the housing units
selected in the fourth stage were included in the sample.[9]  The area
probability sample design was targeted to reach 6,057 housing units;
which, assuming an occupancy rate of .93 would yield 5,633 sample
households, and, with a response rate of .71, 4,000 completed
interviews.
     The high-income sample was drawn from a large sample of 1980
federal income tax returns created by the Statistics of Income
Division (SOI) of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The procedures
for obtaining the high-income sample were designed to shield the
identity of survey respondents from the government and to preserve the
confidentiality of tax returns.  Using multi-faceted sampling
criteria, the Internal Revenue Service selected about 5,000 returns of
high-income taxpayers that were estimated to have large amounts of
wealth.[10]  This sample was drawn from the same primary areas that
were selected for the area probability sample.[11]  The Comptroller of
the Currency sent letters to these 5,000 individuals requesting
participation in the survey.  Four hundred fifty-nine households
notified the Comptroller of the Currency that they were willing to
participate.  This information was forwarded to SRC, which included
these households in the survey sample.[12]
     Under these procedures the IRS never knew the names of the final
respondents.  The SRC did not know the names of the high-income
individuals who were not willing to participate in the survey, nor did
they have access to tax data for survey participants.  The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, which can legally receive such
information from the IRS as a fellow member of the Department of the
Treasury, only knew that the 5,000 individuals had relatively high
incomes; it did not have access to any tax information for these
individuals.
     The same questionnaire was used to interview respondents in both
the area probability and high-income samples, and field interviewers
were not told  which households were part of the high-income sample.
The interview was conducted in person.  Table 1 shows the response
rates, final sample sizes, and average interview length for both the
area probability and high-income samples.  The area probability sample
is somewhat smaller than targeted (4,000).  The shortfall is due
primarily to a higher than expected vacancy and seasonal residence
rate in the selected sample.

     For both samples, selection of the survey respondent within a
household unit (or dwelling), followed a set of pre-determined rules.
Survey interviewers first tried to determine the individual within the
household who was "most knowledgeable" about the household's financial
affairs.  If this could not be determined, interviewers tried to
determine the household's economically "dominant" or "mainstream"
individual, i.e. the individual owning the house, or having
significantly more income.  This individual was selected as the survey
respondent.  In the event that such an individual could not be
identified, such as the case of unrelated roommates sharing living
quarters, the household resident closest to age 45 was selected as
respondent.  If the selected respondent refused to conduct the
interview, survey procedures allowed the substitution of their spouse,
but no other household member.[13]  Once the survey respondent was
ascertained, the survey sampling unit was set as the family of that
individual, termed the "primary family" of the household.  A family is
defined as all individuals residing together in the same household who
are related to each other by blood, marriage, or adoption.  The
primary family could be a one-person unit (if the respondent did not
live with relatives) as well as a unit of two or more individuals.
Individuals having "partners" or other common-law relationships were
treated as married.
     The Census Bureau definition of a household is the same as that
of the SRC.  The Census Bureau, however, distinguishes between
families of two or more persons and single person units.  The Census
defines a family as two or more individuals residing together in the
same housing unit who are related to each other by blood, marriage, or
adoption.  Unrelated individuals are defined as individuals living by
themselves or with unrelated persons.  For each household, the
householder is defined as owner, renter, or economically dominant
individual.  Any families which do not contain the householder are
defined as unrelated subfamilies.  Using these definitions, the SRC
primary family was virtually always the householder by themselves (if
an unrelated individual) or the family of the householder.  Since the
SRC interviewed one primary family per housing unit, the number of
households will be the same as the number of primary families (we use
the terms household and family interchangeably in this manual).
     Interviews were sought with all primary family units; however, no
other families or individuals in the household, such as roomers,
boarders, servants, or roommates, were interviewed (although their age
and sex is noted in the household listing).  The excluded individuals
would be those in unrelated subfamilies and non-householder, unrelated
individuals as defined by the Census.  Rough calculations suggest that
aggregate wealth totals derived from the survey are only slightly
lower (.4 percent) because of the failure to interview all household
members.  SCF household listings indicate that non-interviewed
individuals represent about 4,818,000 people. For the March 1983
Current Population Survey (CPS), the Bureau of the Census estimated
that there were a total of 6,678,000 such persons living in 4,600,000
families, and that they earned 3.8 percent of total household income.
     About one-half of the survey respondents were women including
about 40 percent of the cases of married households (the high-income
sample respondents, though, were virtually all male).  Both spouses
were present during about 40 percent of the married household
interviews, however, and callbacks were used in a significant portion
of the remaining cases to solicit information about a spouse not
present at the interview.  Information on the ownership of assets and
liabilities was solicited only at the family level, and thus cannot be
allocated to specific individuals.  Income on earnings, pensions,
education, and work history was solicited for both the respondent and
their spouse.  Interviewing for the survey was carried out by the
Survey Research Center from February through July 1983.
     A complete, detailed inventory of household assets and debts
including businesses, pensions, properties, and financial items was
collected.  In addition, a comprehensive work history and demographic
data were collected for primary family members.  Additional questions
focused on the use of financial services, specific income sources,
savings and borrowing attitudes, health, and inheritance.  Particular
attention was paid to pension assets, including detailed questions on
types of plans, expected benefits, structure of vesting,
contributions, and current values of identifiable accounts.  The
manual itself provides a detailed list of the questions asked as part
of the survey.

DATA CLEANING AND IMPUTATION
     The actual responses given by respondents may contain missing or
inconsistent information due to respondents' misunderstanding, lack of
knowledge, or unwillingness to answer certain questions.  These
problems make analysis of the raw data difficult and, depending on the
pattern of errors, may bias conclusions.  A series of consistency
checks and imputation procedures was developed at the Federal Reserve
Board to clean the raw data and to estimate values for the missing
data.  The computer code to implement these data cleaning and
imputation procedures is over 40,000 lines long.  Specific information
is given for each variable listed in this manual.  The general
procedures are described below. 
     Overview: Three basic methods were used to impute missing data.
The first method computed missing values by formulas based on
respondent information that was closely related to the missing items.
For example, missing earned income could be imputed from reported wage
rates, hours worked, and work history.  Asset income could be inferred
using average rates of return if asset values were given.  Similarly,
asset values could be estimated from reported asset income.  Length of
unemployment coupled with the appropriate state benefit formula could
be used to impute unemployment income; and work history and Social
Security benefit formulas could be used to impute Social Security
income.  Where appropriate, random disturbances were added in making
imputations. The detailed data were also useful for resolving
inconsistencies in reported values.
     The second method assigned missing values on the basis of random
draws from conditional frequency distributions.  This method was used
primarily to impute missing values for variables with discrete values.
It was also used to estimate dollar amounts in a few cases in which a
very small number of missing values were present.  A variant of this
method involved using a conditional mean together with information
reported by the respondent to estimate the value of a missing item.
The amount borrowed for a first mortgage, for example, was sometimes
estimated by multiplying the purchase price of the house by the
average loan-to-price ratio in the year of purchase.
     The third method estimated missing values by regression.  Missing
values were assigned the value predicted by the regression plus a
random disturbance term, which was generally assumed to be a truncated
log-normal variable with the same variance as the residual term of the
regression.  This method was used to estimate most missing dollar
amounts.  Income and asset regression imputations were done
simultaneously, using an iterative technique, in order to preserve all
second moments.
     Much more was involved in the process of preparing the dataset
than imputation of missing values.  In many instances respondents gave
inconsistent answers to similar questions, which had to be resolved.
There were other instances where assets and/or debts appeared to be
reported twice.  A more common type of problem involved the categories
to which assets were assigned.  For example, many elderly respondents
appeared to confuse Social Security and SSI.  The assignment of assets
to money market accounts or SUPER NOW checking accounts was done
inconsistently by respondents.  Many of these kinds of problems and
inconsistencies resulted in data being changed or moved.
     The area probability and high-income samples were handled
separately.  Missing values for all observations in the high-income
sample were imputed.  In the area probability sample, however, 159 of
the original 3824 observations were discarded because virtually all
dollar amounts for income and assets were missing (this procedure is
described in the next section).  All missing values for the remaining
3665 observations were imputed.  
     Most of the imputations for the 1983 survey were made entirely on
the basis of 1983 data.  In order to preserve the appropriate
inter-temporal correlations, however, some use was made of 1986
responses for those households responding to the 1986 SCF.
Specifically, some 1983 values were reimputed where respondents gave
"hard data" in 1986 for an item which was missing in 1983.
     Wages and Income: Dollar amounts for each missing income source
were imputed separately, and total family income was obtained by
summing income sources.  Missing earned income was estimated using a
wage index to deflate the current wages of the respondent and their
spouse to 1982 levels. If the current wages were missing as well, they
were estimated using conditional mean tables constructed from the
March 1983 CPS.  Missing values were assigned average log-wages for
persons of the same sex, race, age, and three-digit occupation code
plus a random error term.  The random error term was chosen so that
the correlation in wages between an individual's current and past jobs
was the same as that observed for the part of the sample with complete
information.  Missing wage and business income of self-employed
individuals were imputed separately using CPS data for self-employed
individuals.  For the high-income sample, a similar procedure was used
to impute wage and business income.  Missing values were assigned on
the basis of occupation and age, with random error terms added to the
conditional means.  The conditional means were obtained from the
high-income sample itself, however, not the CPS.
     Unemployment compensation was imputed using state benefit rules
and job information reported in the employment section.  Some pension
and Social Security income was estimated using information from the
employment section, but most was imputed by regression.  Welfare was
imputed by regression using state benefit formulas.  Interest and
dividend income was estimated by multiplying dollar amounts of various
types of assets held by the appropriate average yields for those
assets in 1982.  Average yields were obtained from the Federal Reserve
Bulletin and other publications.
     Assets: Missing values for most financial assets were estimated
either by capitalizing interest and dividend income or by regression
if these income sources were not reported.  The procedure used when
both income and financial asset values were missing was an iterative
one that imputes income and asset values simultaneously.  It builds
maximum likelihood estimates of the covariance matrix of the set of
imputed variables conditioned on demographic and other variables under
the assumption that they are jointly log-normal and that given such
information observations are missing randomly.  Imputed values are
conditional expectations plus a random error.
     Missing house values were imputed by inflating reported purchase
prices by regional housing price indices.  Some house values, and all
other missing real estate, life insurance, net equity of businesses,
and some land contracts were imputed by regression.  Automobile values
were imputed by matching the year and make of the vehicle to the
National Association of Automobile Dealers "blue book" listing of used
car values at the time of the survey.
     Debts: Respondents were asked to report dollar amounts
outstanding for open-end and non-installment closed-end debts.
Missing dollar amounts were estimated by regression.  Asset values,
income, and other demographic characteristics of the family were used
as predictor variables. Random errors were added to the predicted
amounts outstanding.
     Respondents reported credit terms -- payment size, frequency,
amount borrowed, due date, and interest rate -- for mortgages, land
contracts, and other real estate loans.  Some payments had to be
adjusted because the reported amount included taxes and insurance.
The amount outstanding on each loan could then be obtained by
calculating the present value of remaining payments of principal and
interest.  Missing credit terms were estimated using appropriate
average interest rates, maturities, and loan-to-price ratios published
in the Federal Reserve Bulletin (the amount outstanding could actually
be computed even if one term was not reported, because of a redundancy).
     Similar information was collected for closed-end installment
debt, although interest rates were not reported.  Sufficient
information was available if all other terms were reported to solve
for the implied interest rate.  The amount outstanding for each loan
could then be computed in the same fashion as used for mortgages.
When one of the terms was missing or the computed interest was
implausible, an appropriate interest rate from the Federal Reserve
Bulletin was assumed for area probability sample observations.  For
high-income sample observations, missing values were assigned on the
basis of matches to other comparable loans in the high-income sample.
     Summary Data on Imputation: The impact of the imputation process
used for the SCF is apparent from the non-response rates given for
selected assets and liabilities in table 2.  Non-response rates for
ownership ("do you have a .. .?") and dollar amounts ("what is its
value?") were computed for three subsamples -- the high-income sample,
the 3665 edited area probability observations, and the 159 discarded
area probability observations.  The non-response rate for each item
was computed by dividing the number of missing responses by the
number of times that a question was asked.  Dollar amounts were asked
only if a respondent acknowledged ownership; and for closed-end
installment debts, where amount outstanding was computed rather than
reported, refer to the amount borrowed or payment size.  For other
debts, dollar amounts refer to amount outstanding.  There are no
non-response rates for automobile value because this value was
calculated from reported make and model and was not solicited from
respondents.

     Note that few respondents failed to acknowledge ownership of
specific items.  Non-response rates for dollar amounts, however, are
significantly larger.[14]  The high-income sample has lower non-response
rates than the area probability sample for virtually every item,
despite the fact that the survey lasted longer on average for the
high-income sample and respondents had more complex finances.  This
may reflect the fact that high-income respondents had to agree to
participate before they were even approached by an interviewer.
     The effects of missing value imputations on asset totals are
shown in table 3.  The first and third columns show the percentage of
the final weighted total of each asset that stems from dollar values
given by respondents.  The difference between this number and 100 is
the percentage of each asset's dollar total that was imputed.
Percentages are given separately for the edited area probability and
the high-income group.  Imputations accounted for less than 10 percent
of total asset values in ten of the twelve asset categories in the
high-income sample but in only four of the twelve categories in the
area probability sample.  For every asset category, the proportion of
total assets accounted for by imputations is lower in the high-income
sample than in the area probability sample.  Cash value of life
insurance is the lowest quality item -- imputations account for 41
percent of total cash value in the high-income sample and 76 percent
of the cash value in the area probability sample.

     To examine the robustness of the imputation procedures each
sample was "re-imputed" by assigning the sample mean to each missing
dollar value instead of the more complex imputations actually used.[15]
The figures in columns 2 and 4 of table 3 are the aggregate
percentages of each sample including the original imputations
accounted for by samples including the more crude mean-based
imputations.  Most percentages are quite close to 100.  The poor data
on the cash value of life insurance, however, is again reflected by
the fact that its overall total is quite sensitive to the imputation
procedures used.  The life insurance percentages of less than 100
suggest that observations with missing data were those with higher
than average values (at least as predicted by our more complex
imputations).  Conversely the 118 percent figure for the area
probability sample business assets suggests that cross-sectional
observations with missing business data were smaller than average.
These figures suggest that the patterns of nonresponse are complex,
and that simplistic imputation procedures are likely to be flawed.

SAMPLE WEIGHTS
     For a variety of reasons, final household survey data will rarely
represent a random draw from the U.S. population.  Even if the
original survey design were random, different types of households will
have different likelihoods of completing interviews.  Very high and
very low income households, for example, are thought to be less likely
to participate in surveys.  The 1983 SCF had an additional source of
non-randomness because of the inclusion of the high-income supplement.
These factors necessitated the construction of weighting variables to
compensate for known or estimable sources of stratification in the
final data set.  Several different weights were constructed.
     Inclusion of households in the final "cleaned" data set described
in this manual results from a series of implicit stratified selection
criteria.  There are four major sources of implicit stratification.
First, there are different response rates for different household
types.  This occurs because households cannot be reached (up to six
attempts to contact participants were made) or because they refuse to
participate when contacted.  Second, the sample may not fully reflect
U.S. population due to sampling error in the survey itself (in the
sense that any random sample will not have exactly the same average
characteristics as the population from which it is drawn).  Third, as
mentioned above, not all survey observations were usable for analysis
because of significant missing information due to deliberate or
inadvertent actions.  Of the 3,824 area probability sample survey
households included in the original SRC data tape, 159 observations
were dropped in the cleaned file.  Finally, the SCF sample is drawn
from both the area probability and high-income sampling frames.  If
both samples are used, it is necessary to properly mix them to have a
representative national sample.
     There are a number of ways which can be used to compensate for
these types of sample stratification.  The method employed here is to
construct sample weights, which can be used to adjust the final
sample.  Briefly, the weights were calculated as follows.
     Area Probability sample weights: The original SRC sampling frame
called for sampling 6,062 housing units in the cross-section.  If each
housing unit had yielded an interview, each observation would
represent 13,333 housing units.  In fact as shown earlier in table 1,
only about 89 percent of the housing units were occupied, and of
these, only about 71 percent (3824) contained households who were
willing to participate in the survey.  Obviously, the exact
characteristics of the non-responding households are unknown; however,
the response and occupancy rate differed significantly across the
survey's 75 PSUs.  The "non-response" weight adjusts for this
differential non-response.  This weight is equal to the reciprocal of
the household response rate for the PSU for which the household
belongs.  This weight should compensate for some location-related
characteristics associated with non-response and occupancy.
     The second type of stratification cited above can be adjusted for
by taking into account how the final area probability sample (weighted
for "non-response") compares with the population according to certain
select characteristics.  Obviously the sample could be adjusted for
any one of a number of characteristics (age, income, size of
household, region, etc.).  SRC elected to compensate for regional
sampling error by computing a "post-stratification" weight which
adjusts the sample to have the same relative population as the 1980
census in the four major sample regions (Northeast, South, North
Central, and West) further subdivided into urban and rural.  We
computed a similar weight, but post-stratified to the population and
urban/rural definitions represented by the March 1983 CPS.
     The third type of stratification cited above can be adjusted for
in two different ways.  The criteria for inclusion in the cleaned area
probability sample was as follows.  Any observation with any dollar
values given for earnings or income was automatically included.
Remaining observations were excluded only if there were virtually no
dollar values given for housing value (or rent), other property
values, business, and financial assets.  Information on debts was not
used in this section.  Specific rules were employed to exclude
observations whose ratio of missing data to relevant questions
exceeded a certain level.  In practice those observations that were
dropped were missing values for virtually all dollar value questions
they were asked.[16]  None of the high-income sample observations were
dropped.  In fact, these  observations were remarkably clean, with
comparatively little missing information.
     To compensate for these exclusions, a probit model was fit to
model the probability that an observation in the complete 3824 area
probability sample file would be included in the cleaned
3665-observation data set.  Variables used in this model were selected
as follows.  Most asset questions consisted of two parts.  An initial
screen question which asked if the respondent had an asset, and a
follow-up for those acknowledging ownership, asking how much they had.
In virtually every instance of missing values, it was the second
question which was not answered rather than the first.  Thus, the
probit model predicting inclusion in the cleaned sample used a number
of the first type of questions, as well as standard demographic data
available for all observations, as predictor variables.
     The fitted probit equation results can be used in two ways.  The
inverse of the predicted probability that an observation would have
been included in the cleaned sample (conditioned on the predictor
variables used), can be used to weight observations in analysis.  In
practice, this procedure implies higher weights for observations
holding a large number of different assets.
     An alternative way of using the probit results attempts to
account explicitly for correlation between inclusion in the sample and
the error term of an estimated equation.  A variable has been created
which is the expectation of the "error" in the inclusion equation,
conditioned on the fact that the observation indeed turned out to be
included (the so-called Mills ratio).  This variable can be included
as a regressor in estimated equations and will account for "sample
selection" bias under certain assumptions.
     High-Income and full sample weights: The weights for the combined
sample containing both the area probability and high-income samples
were more difficult to compute, and are more subject to question.
Unfortunately full information on the high-income sampling procedure
is not publicly available.  Additional complications stem from the
fact that the high-income observations were drawn from a 1980 sampling
frame of taxpayers (but were contacted in 1983) and the fact that the
reporting basis for tax files (individuals or married couples) is not
always the same as the survey (families).
     Initially, the Office of Tax Analysis used a statistical file set
up by the IRS to construct relative weights for the high-income sample
(the sample was divided into nine cells each with a separate weight).
These weights are supposed to make the high-income sample
representative of the unknown full IRS sampling frame.  SRC
constructed sample distributions for the overlap of the area
probability and high-income samples (over $100,000 dollars in
household income) to compute a "meshed" combined sample weight.  The
SRC weight retained the relative weights of the high-income sample and
left the weight for area probability observations below $100,000
largely unchanged.[17]
     Well after the initial SRC full sample weights were computed,
information on the upper tail of the distribution of 1982 taxpayers
became available.  When this was compared to reported 1982 household
income in the SCF sample, it appeared that the SRC meshed weight may
have given too much weight to the high-income sample.  As a
consequence, another full-sample weight was constructed at the Federal
Reserve Board which used a different approach to combine the two
samples.  It was decided to construct sampling weights for the
high-income sample (and area probability observations with income
above a certain level) using a post-stratification scheme based on
control totals for an "extended" income measure constructed from the
1982 Tax Model File (TMF) of the IRS.  The TMF is a stratified sample
of 88,218 individual tax returns with a significant over-sampling of
high incomes.[18]
     This income measure, which was constructed for all survey
households using reported 1982 income data, is roughly comparable to
the IRS measure of adjusted gross income plus excluded realized
capital gains.  Despite the fairly detailed income questions in the
SCF, it is clear that the survey measure of business income almost
surely overstates the TMF measure.  It appears likely that survey
respondents often report something much closer to a cash-flow concept
of income rather than income netted of expenses and depreciation.
Unfortunately, there is not sufficient information in either the SCF
or the TMF to make a precise compensating adjustment.  A gross
adjustment for the aggregate difference between the survey and TMF
business income totals was made in constructing the survey measure of
extended income. Reported business income in the SCF was deflated by
about 40 percent so that IRS and adjusted survey aggregates of
business income were the same.  This adjustment was quite ad hoc,
however, and the potential for distortion at the individual level
remains, with weights for households with business income particularly
suspect.
     Because the reporting units in the survey and the TMF differ, the
TMF data were adjusted in  order to estimate income on a family basis.
Most of the high-income returns in the TMF are either joint filings or
those of single individuals.  However, there are some married couples
filing separately, particularly in the $50,000 to $100,000 income
range.  These observations were "aggregated" into households by
assuming that separate filers were all married to people with the same
income (weights for such observations were halved).  The final weights
are only slightly affected by variations in this adjustment.
     Post-stratification cells were defined by the seven categories of
extended income shown in table 4.  For each of the top six income
cells (above $80,000), weights were determined so that the weighted
number of survey observations equaled the TMF totals.  High-income
observations were assigned the cell average.  Area probability sample
observations were assigned relative weights based on their
cross-section weight, but scaled so that the mean for each of the six
cells was the same as that of the high-income observations.  The
original weights of the area probability observations with income
below $80,000 were adjusted so that the weighted number of SCF
households equaled the population estimated from the March 1983 CPS.
High-income sample observations with income below $80,000 were
arbitrarily assigned the same weight as observations in the $80,000 to
$90,000 group.

     Most of the work done to date with the 1983 SCF has used the SRC
meshed weights.  Subsequent calculations suggest that the two
different weighting schemes may not make as much difference as
originally expected.  Aggregate wealth estimates constructed using the
SRC weight are about 5.0% higher than those estimated with the Federal
Reserve weight.  Aggregate income estimates are 3.6% higher.
     The importance of the weights is shown by the numbers in table 5.
Columns 1 - 3 show the distribution of the unweighted area
probability, high-income, and total samples over various demographic
items.  Columns 4 and 5 show the weighted sample distribution of the
same items using the area probability weight (column 4) and the FRB
extended income weight (column 5).  The unweighted sample clearly
shows an over-representation of elderly, high-income, wealthy, white,
and married households relative to all of the weighted samples.

     Further evidence on the importance of the high-income sample and
the need for proper weighting is shown by the summary statistics for
various components of household wealth given in tables 6 and 7.  Table
6 shows aggregate estimates using only the area probability sample,
weighted with the area probability sample weights.  Table 7 gives the
same estimates with the full sample weighted with the FRB extended
income weights.[19]  Note that there is virtually no difference in the
estimates of median holdings of owners and the percentage of
households owning various asset and debt items between the area
probability and full sample.  However, for the estimates of mean and
aggregate holdings.  Despite their being weighted to represent the
same population, the area probability and full-sample estimates of a
number of aggregates look quite different.

COMPARABILITY WITH OTHER SURVEYS
	The 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances is the most recent survey
in a series of surveys of household finances conducted by the Survey
Research Center of the University of Michigan.  Surveys of Consumer
Finances were conducted annually from 1946 and 1970 but were then
discontinued.[20]  In 1977, the Survey Research Center conducted a
comprehensive household finance survey again, under the sponsorship of
the Federal Reserve Board and other federal bank regulatory
agencies.[21]  The same basic methods were used in all these surveys,
although changes in sampling and interviewing procedures were
introduced from time to time to improve survey results.  The content
of the surveys also changed over time because of shifts in interest in
various aspects of consumer finances.  The early surveys, which were
sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board, were concerned with the effect
of the postwar accumulation of liquid assets on consumer spending.
Mortgage and consumer credit received greater attention in later
surveys, and a major part of the 1977 survey was concerned with the
effect of federal regulations on consumer credit use.  Nevertheless,
several areas of inquiry were followed through much of the 1946-77
period, and results from the earlier surveys are generally comparable
to those from the area probability sample for the 1983 SCF.
     The Federal Reserve Board also sponsored the Survey of Financial
Characteristics of Consumers (SFCC) in 1963, with a followup
reinterview in 1964.[22]    Methodological work for this survey was
conducted by the SRC, and interviewing was performed by the Bureau of
the Census.  Like the 1983 SCF, the 1963 SFCC collected a more
detailed inventory of assets and liabilities than is customary in
other consumer surveys.  The 1963 survey also used Federal tax
information to oversample high- income households.  For the 1963
survey, a sample of housing units stratified by income reported in the
1960 Decennial Census was selected to represent households with
incomes below $50,000. Households with incomes of $50,000 or more were
selected from a sample of 1960 Federal income tax returns.  Although
this sample selection procedure is not exactly the same as that used
for the 1983 survey, it produced a heavy over-sampling of households
in the upper end of the income distribution, making the 1963 sample
the only household survey sample that is comparable to the full sample
from the 1983 SCF.
     The Federal Reserve has also sponsored several recent surveys on
the use of different means of payment for household purchases.  The
Survey of Currency and Transaction Account Usage, conducted by the SRC
in the summer of 1984, solicited detailed information on the use of
checking, savings, and money market accounts for about 2,000
households.  Data were also collected on the use of currency, credit
cards, money orders, and electronic banking services.  In 1986, the
survey was repeated for a smaller sample.[23]  	Wealth information is
also available from other sources.  Data from the Internal Revenue
Service for federal estate tax returns have been used to estimate
total household wealth and its percentage distribution.
Unfortunately, data from this source are available only in aggregate
form, with very limited demographic breakdowns.  Another source is the
1979 Income Survey Development Program of the Department of Health and
Human Services, which provides information for a sample of households
larger than that of most other surveys of wealth.  The New York Stock
Exchange has also periodically conducted surveys of household
stockholders, doing a survey at a time comparable to the SCF in 1983,
and more recently, in 1985.  Wealth data was also collected for
respondents to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) in 1984.
     The most comprehensive recent survey of household wealth was
conducted in 1984 (and repeated in 1985) by the Bureau of the Census
on participants in the Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP).  This survey solicited information similar to the SCF for a
very large sample of households.  Its initial panel was a random
cross-section of about 21,000 households selected by procedures
similar to those used to select the area probability sample for the
1983 SCF.  Net worth information was collected between September and
December 1984.[24]  Aggregate wealth estimates from the earlier
Surveys of Consumer Finances and SIPP are generally comparable to
those from the area probability sample of the 1983 SCF in their
understatement of aggregate wealth relative estimates from independent
sources.  Using comparably defined categories, we estimate an
aggregate net worth for the SCF area probability sample of $8,277
billion versus a $7,740 billion total for the SIPP sample.  The
difference derives primarily from a smaller estimate of small business
assets in the SIPP.  The full-sample SCF estimate of the same net
wealth concept is $9,610 billion.  Thus, it appears that the major
difference between the two surveys arises from the inclusion of the
high-income sample in the SCF.
     The annual March Current Population Survey is perhaps the most
comprehensive U.S. household economic survey, soliciting economic
information from approximately 59,000 households (U.S. Bureau of the
Census (1984)).  The representativeness of the SCF is demonstrated by
a comparison of the sample distribution of various demographic
variables for the SCF and comparable March 1983 CPS survey in table 8.
The CPS data are given for "primary families" defined comparably to
families in the SCF.  As can be seen, the  SCF has a very similar
distribution for most items.

     The CPS does not collect wealth data comparable to the SCF.
However, detailed household money income, by source, is available from
both the CPS and SCF.  A comparison of 1982 U.S. household totals for
a number of income categories measured by both the SCF and the March
1983 CPS is displayed in Table 9.  The CPS totals are adjusted to
exclude income for secondary families and unrelated individuals, who
would not have been included in the SCF.  We also show a comparison of
the SCF income data with aggregate 1982 household income compiled by
the IRS from tax return data.  A selection of cases was made from the
SCF to represent the population of households that would normally file
tax returns.  Non-taxable income was deleted for these calculations.

     The 1983 SCF overstates comparable CPS income by about 6 percent.
Most of this overstatement stems from business income and income from
dividends, trusts, and real estate.  Interestingly, in a comparison of
data with an "independent source" in 1983, the Census Bureau concluded
that CPS income data "underreported by about 10 percent" (U.S. Bureau
of the Census (1985, p. 218)).  The SCF also overstates IRS household
income by about 7 percent.  Much of the discrepancy can be explained
by the SCF's failure to find significant business, rental, and
security losses.

PENSION PROVIDER SURVEY
     The sample for the study of Employer Sponsored Pension Benefit
Plans was derived in three interdependent stages.  The overall
research design was based on the use of the 1983 SCF to identify, in
turn: which households were covered by employer sponsored pensions;
which pension providers and plans covered these employees; and which
benefit formulas and requirements governed these pension entitlements.
All respondents or spouses with work experience were questioned about
pension coverage on their current job, as well as vested pension
entitlements from prior employers as part of the SCF.  Households that
reported pension coverage were asked to identify the provider of the
pension -- in most cases, their employer.  All the pension providers
thus identified were pooled and duplicate references to the same
provider were combined.
     In many instances sufficient information was available from the
name of the pension provider to uniquely identify them, and from files
available at the Department of labor to identify their Employer
Identification Number (EIN).  In other instances, a telephone
interview was conducted with the pension provider.  The provider was
asked for their EIN and for documentation of the pension plans that
covered workers in the occupational classification and work location
that corresponded to the reference SCF respondent(s) applying to that
provider (the names of the SCF respondents were not disclosed to the
pension providers who were told that SRC was doing a survey of
pensions).  Pension Providers were recontacted by mail and telephone
as necessary to insure a high response rate.
     The EIN and plan names and numbers were sufficient in most
instances for SRC staff to match to official plan descriptions (SPDs)
on file with the Department of Labor for most pension providers.  In
other instances the providers sent the SPDs or similar material to
SRC.  The details of the plans were then coded from the SPDs using a
coding instrument developed by Mathematica Policy Research and SRC.
Coders were hired by SRC specifically for the project, which required
more skill than is generally necessary for coding (the final
instrument has about 2,700 variables).  Information was compiled
separately for defined benefit and defined contribution plans.  1886
households (2262 individuals) were eligible for potential inclusion in
the Pension Provider Survey.  Of this total 1421 households (1641
individuals) were represented in the Pension Plan Survey for a 75
percent completion rate.  These span 845 pension providers and 1011
pension plans.  Data for the Pension Provider Survey is currently
being distributed as part of the 1983 SCF package.  A description of
the survey is found in "Survey of Consumer Finances: Employer
Sponsored Pension Benefits Plans," the Survey Research Center, 1986,
by Richard T. Curtin.[25]

1986 SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES
     The 1986 Survey re-interviewed respondents to the 1983 SCF.  If
the respondent had been divorced or separated since the 1983
interview, both the 1983 respondent and their 1983 spouse were
included in the 1986 sample.  Other members who left the family to
form new households were not included.  A total of 2,822 interviews
were conducted, by telephone, between June and September 1986.
Interviews lasted an average of 27 minutes.  The survey was conducted
by the SRC under the direction of Richard T. Curtin.
     The 1986 interview was primarily designed to update essential
information in the 1983 SCF on the household balance sheet (needed to
calculate savings) and employment data.  However, additional lines of
inquiry were also opened.  Questions were asked about health and
educational expenses, insurance coverage, more detailed data on family
and family change (including marriage, divorce, death of a spouse,
children outside the home, and ages of parents), charitable gifts of
money and time, shared living arrangements, intra-family transfers and
the financial details of divorce settlements.  A limited amount of
analysis has been performed on the data.  See:

MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS
     In the remainder of the manual, information is given on all the
variables included in the final dataset.  A brief description is given
for each variable along with information on imputation and a listing
of the values that the variable takes on.  The question number
corresponding to the actual survey questionnaire (e.g. R9) is also
given for all variables except recodes.  Variables are listed by
number, with the numeric code used as the basis of the variable's
internal name in the survey's SAS data set.  All variables listed here
have a "B" prefix followed by a four digit number ranging from 3001 to
5749.  The original uncleaned survey responses are contained in
variables with a "V" prefix.  These variables range from V1 to V2613.
The codes for the "V" variables are described in the original survey
codebook released by the SRC.  We note, though, that the "B" variables
contain all the same types of information as those contained in the
"V" variables.  Thus, for most analyses, it is possible to use the "B"
variables without reference to the "V" variables.
     The range of allowable values of the variables is also given.
The symbol xxxx is used for continuous variables with a statement of
the units used and the sample range.  For discrete variables with a
small number of allowable codes, all possible values and their
meanings are listed.  The number of sample cases (out of the 4103
"cleaned" observations) taking on each value of discrete variables is
also given.  If the listing is for several variables (such as the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd automobiles), then the case totals are given for the
listed variables, in order, separated by slashes (e.g. 123/45/87
cases).  Although useful in giving a flavor of the distribution of
responses to questions, the case listings should not be used for
statistical purposes, as they are unweighted distributions.
     Most of the information collected for the 1983 SCF applies to the
full family unit.  Some information, however, such as employment,
education, health, and pension income, was collected individually for
the survey respondent and their spouse (if they had one).  For married
couples, the respondent could have been either the husband or the
wife.  For ease of use in analysis most of the person-specific
variables in the cleaned dataset have been arranged as "head" and
"spouse," (where head is always the husband for married couples),
instead of "respondent" and "spouse."  It is easy to switch data back,
if desired, by using the variable B3122 which indicates whether the
respondent was the head or the spouse. 
     Several different codes are used in the dataset, including:

     (1)  The code "1" is almost always used for the answer "yes" to a
          question;

     (2)  The code "3" is generally used for the answer "sometimes" or
          "maybe";

     (3)  The code "5" is almost always used for the answer "no" to a
          question;

     (4)  The code "-4" is used to denote a "small negative number";
	
     (5)  The code "-6" is used to denote the answer "none" which is
          sometimes differentiated from zero;

     (6)  The code "-7" is used to denote a special "other" response
          which does not fit into existing codes.  SRC has cards
          indicating what the actual response is.  "-7" is also
          sometimes used to denote answers like "forever" or "never"
          when used for continuous variables;

     (7)  The code "-8" is used to denote the answer "don't know"
          (DK).  Most DKs have been imputed, but some still exist for
          selected variables where imputation is not appropriate
          (e.g. attitudinal variables).  In a few instances "8" is
          used for DK; 

     (8)  The code "-9" is used to denote "not answered" (NA).  This
          indicates either that the interviewer inadvertently did not
          ask a question or  that a respondent refused to answer.
          Most NAs have been imputed, but a few remain.  In a few
          instances "9" is used for NA; 

     (9)  The code "0" is generally used to denote cases where a
          variable is inappropriate for a particular observation
          because the question which underlies the variable was not
          asked.  For example, questions on spouses would be
          inappropriate for single households.  Note that sometimes a
          question is asked, but the answer given is none or zero
          (such as "my business is worth nothing").  These answers are
          generally coded as -6 not 0.  There are some instances,
          particularly with recoded variables, where 0 does denote
          none or nothing.

     All variables on the tape are integers.  All dollar amounts are
given in whole dollars (although in answering the questions
respondents may have rounded).  Some variables had to be rescaled so
that information would not be lost (such as percentage answers which
are generally multiplied by 100).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
     Many people contributed to the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances.
Sampling, field work, editing, and coding were conducted by the Survey
Research Center of the University of Michigan under the direction of
Richard T. Curtin.  Mr. Curtin also oversaw the cleaning and
processing of the Pension Provider Survey data.  Other SRC staff also
made substantial contributions.  Mary Grace Moore and Lisa Poole

and editing procedures.  Steve G. Heeringa supervised the sample
design and drawing of the SRC sample.  Field work was supervised by
Nancy Gebler.  Coding and editing staff were supervised by Joan
Scheffler.  Much of the field work, and the development of the coding
instrument for the Pension Provider Survey was done by Mathematica
Policy Research.  Miles Maxfield and Tim Carr supervised these
activities.

Services co-authored the questionnaire, taking primary responsibility
for the pension questions and overseeing the development of the
Pension Provider Survey.  Arthur Kennickell, of the Federal Reserve
Board, developed the Federal Reserve Board weights, helped in writing
this manual, and played a critical role in the later stages of data
cleaning and imputation.  He also co-authored the 1986 Survey of
Consumer Finances.

WEIGHTS AND I.D. CODES
     Inclusion of households in the final "cleaned" survey sample
results from a series of implicit stratified selection criteria.
There are three major sources of implicit stratification:  
(1) within the area probability sample, certain types of households
turned out to be less likely to participate in the survey when
selected; (2) the sample is unlikely to fully reflect the
U.S. population due to sampling error in the survey itself; 
and, (3) not all observations turned out to be usable for analysis
because of significant missing information due to deliberate or
inadvertent actions.  Another relevant issue is the fact that two
different sampling frames, area probability and IRS tax files, were
used to draw observations.  Methods used to construct weights to
compensate for these sources of stratification and mix the area
probability sample and high-income observations are described fully in
the summary.  This section presents information on specific weighting
variables.  We should note, that throughout this section, case totals
reflect the entire 4,262 observation sample.  In all other sections of
the manual, case totals reflect the 4,103 observation "cleaned" sample.

                                       ENDNOTES
   1. The interview questionnaire for the household survey was
prepared by Robert B. Avery and Gregory E. Elliehausen, of the Federal
Reserve Board, and Thomas A. Gustafson, of the Department of Health
and Human Services, with assistance from staffs of the sponsoring
agencies.  Field work and editing and coding of survey responses was
performed under the direction of Richard T. Curtin of the SRC.
Mr. Curtin and Timothy Carr and Miles Maxfield, of Mathematica Policy
Research, administered the Pension Provider Survey.  The Statistics of
Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service, provided the
high-income sample.

   2. A household consists of all the persons who occupy a housing
unit or dwelling.  Persons missed by the survey will be
disproportionately young, because they are college or the military,
and old, because they are in nursing homes.  The later omission,
effecting an estimated 1.4 million people, is the most serious in
terms of wealth measurement.  However, the failure to include a large
number of younger persons is likely to effect the long run
representativeness of the SCF when used as a panel.

   3.Non-SMSA counties with less than 2,000 population were linked
with adjacent counties to form multi-county PSUs.  The SCF sample used
the 1970 SRC sampling frame which was selected from a national
population of 2,700 PSUs, of which 12 were self-representing.  In
addition to SMSA status, the 62 nonself-representing strata were
designed to take into account the location (Census Region), the
population, size of the largest city, and percent manufacturing
(urban) or agricultural (rural) employment of each area.  In the South
Region, the percent black population and a special domain distinction
labeled "the Deep South" (South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana) was also used.  By design, the nonself-
representing strata are of approximately equal size each totaling
between 1.7 and 2.5 million population in 1970.

   4. Because New York City is so large, it is treated as though it is
made up of two PSUs.  Thus, we treat the sample as having 75 PSUs, not
74.


   5. The sampling of the second stage units (SSU's) was performed
with probability proportionate to size as measured by the 1970 Census
count of year-round housing units.  In most areas, the largest or
"central" city of each sample PSU was included with certainty.  The
second stage was dropped from the 1980 SRC National Sample design.


   6. The units selected in the third stage are termed "chunks."  In
urbanized areas chunks are defined to be housing units within the land
area given by a Census Block.  However, Blocks with less than 16 year-
round housing units were combined with adjacent Blocks to meet a
minimum 16 unit size.  In rural areas, chunks were defined to be
compact parcels of land with clearly recognizable physical boundaries
(roads, rivers, rail lines, etc.) selected with an expected count of
24 year-round housing units.  Within SSU's the sample of chunks were
selected with probability proportionate to their number of year-round
housing units.

   7. Once the third stage of selection was complete, SRC personnel
performed a complete listing of all housing units within the physical
boundaries of each chunk.  For the 1983 SCF about three-fourths of the
chunks has been previously listed for other surveys; thus only
updating of the listings were necessary.  These lists formed the basis
of selection for the fourth stage of sampling.


   8. Housing units were selected randomly within each chunk.  The
sampling rate was set inversely proportional to the number of year-
round housing units within the chunk as determined by the listings.

   9. These procedures followed fairly standard SRC methods.  For a
more detailed description of these methods, see Irene Hess, Sampling
for Social Research Surveys: 1947-1980, Ann Arbor: Institute for
Social Research, 1985.

  10. Unfortunately, because of legal restrictions, knowledge of the
exact sampling procedures is restricted to employees of the SOI.  The
sample drawn appears to roughly coincide with individuals having an
"adjusted gross income," modified for full capital gains and other
exclusions, of $100,000 or more in 1980.

  11. Actually only the 12 self-representing and 31 of the 62 nonself-
representing PSUs were used for the high-income sample list.  The
decision to exclude high-income households in the remaining nonself-
representing PSUs was based on a joint consideration of survey costs
and the relatively small expected size of the high-income sample.
Because the SOI listings were by address, and the area probability
PSUs were defined by county, some slight approximations were used in
defining the SOI sample.  The actual SOI sample was defined by the ZIP
codes corresponding to the SRC sample counties, with the county
location of the main post office in a ZIP code used when county and
ZIP code boundaries did not correspond exactly.

  12. The overall response rate of the high-income mailing (9 percent)
may not be quite as bad as it appears.  SOI typically has response
rates of no more than 20 to 30 percent even for mailings extremely
favorable to the respondent.  The low 1983 SCF response rate was also
caused by the failure to send a followup letter.

  13. These procedures differ slightly from the procedures normally
used for the selection of household respondent by SRC.  Generally,
only the economic dominance and age closest to 45 criteria are used.

  14. Rates for income non-response were much higher.  1.8 percent of
the high-income sample gave no income data, and an additional 4.6
percent gave only partial data.  Comparable figures for the edited
area probability sample were 5.5 percent and 7.1 percent.  Only 2
percent of the discarded area probability sample respondents gave any
income data, and these respondents gave only partial data.

  15. Means were computed separately for the high-income and cross-
section sample on an item-by-item basis and were based only on
respondents who gave dollar values.

  16. One household was discarded which did not meet these criteria
because it reported more than a billion dollars in assets and appeared
to be an insincere interview.

  19. An estimate of the standard error due to sampling of the
estimated aggregate of each asset and liability category is given in
column 2.  These figures were computed by calculating the sample
variance of each item within each sampling unit (75 area probability
PSUs and nine high-income categories).  Assuming independence of
sample draws across each of these cells, the variance of an asset or
debt category total was then calculated as the sum of the variances of
each item included in that category weighted by the cell populations.
Because these estimates take the sampling weights as fixed they are
likely to understate the true sampling variance of the weighted sums.

        This is a unique observation identifier.  It corresponds to
        the case I.D. on the actual interview facesheet.  It was
        assigned chronologically in the order the interviews were
        processed.

        xxxx. code (1 to 4288)


B3001 	SAMPLE CODE.
        This code indicates which sample the observation is in.

        1. high-income sample (438 cases)
        2. area probability sample "cleaned" sample (3665 cases)
        3. area probability sample excluded observations (159 cases)

B3002 	NON-RESPONSE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR.
        This variable adjusts the area probability sample for the first type of
        stratification cited above.  The non-response adjustment
        factor is computed as the reciprocal of the household response
        rate of the primary sampling unit (PSU) to which the household
        belongs (see variable B3013).  There are 75 different PSUs in
        the sample (although there are only 64 unique values for
        B3002).  The range of this variable is 1.055 to 2.924 with a
        mean of 1.41013 for the full area probability sample.

            0. high-income sample (438 cases)


B3003 	1980 POST-STRATIFICATION WEIGHT.
	This variable provides one adjustment for the second factor
        cited above.  It adjusts the full area probability sample
        (weighted by B3002) to have the same total number of
        households as the 1980 census (excluding Alaska and Hawaii).
        It separately weights the sample for the four regions of the
        country (see B3117) further divided by urban (center city and
        suburbs, B3118 = 1-4) and rural (adjacent and outlying
        divisions, B3118 = 5-6).  Urban/rural distinctions are
        determined for each observation according to the treatment of
        its area in the 1970 Census (although population figures are
        given as of 1980).  B3003 takes on only seven possible values,
        with a mean of 14840.1. 

	13733. urban south (622 cases)
	14133. urban northeast (562 cases)
 	14133. urban north central (625 cases)
	15280. rural north central (435 cases)
	15400. rural northeast (211 cases)
	15613. urban west (482 cases)
	15680. rural south (729 cases)
	16319. rural west (158 cases)
	    0. high-income sample (438 cases)


B3004 	1983 POST-STRATIFICATION WEIGHT.
	This variable is identical to B3003 except that a different
        post-stratification scheme is used.  Observations were grouped
        into five geographic areas within each U.S. region: (1)
        central cities of SMSAs with more than 1,000,000 persons
        (B3119 = 1,2); (2) other areas within SMSAs with more than
        1,000,000 persons (B3119 = 4,5); (3) central cities of SMSAs
        with less than 1,000,000 (B3119 = 3); (4) other areas within
        SMSAs with less than 1,000,000 (B3119 = 6); and (5) non-SMSA
        areas (B3119 = 7).  SMSA and central city distinctions were
        made according to 1970 Census definitions, because these were
        used in the basic sampling frame.  The one million person
        cutoff, however, was made according to the 1983 estimated
        population of each 1970-defined SMSA.  Post-stratification
        weights were computed for each of the 20 U.S. areas to blow-up
        the full area probability sample (adjusted for non-response)
        into the estimated 1983 U.S. total of 83,918,000 households
        (and the 20 sub-groups as well).  Unlike B3003, the
        post-stratification for the western region in B3004 includes
        Alaska and Hawaii.  This ex-post weighting scheme is
        essentially the same as that used by the Census Bureau in
        reporting the March 1983 CPS survey, which used a similar
        sampling strategy as that of the SCF.

B3005 	FULL SAMPLE 1983 COMPOSITE WEIGHT.
	This variable is equal to the non-response adjustment factor
        weight (B3002) times the 1983 post-stratification weight
        (B3004).  THIS IS THE RECOMMENDED WEIGHT TO USE WITH THE FULL
        AREA PROBABILITY SAMPLE.  This weight will "blow up" the 3,824
        observation full area probability sample into the aggregate
        U.S. household population (including Alaska and Hawaii) as
        measured by the 1983 CPS.  The average value of B3005 is

B3007 	CLEANED SAMPLE INCLUSION WEIGHT.
	This variable is the inverse of the estimated probability that
        an observation would be included in the cleaned area
        probability sample, given it is in the full area probability
        sample.  Its average is 1.04313.  This variable will blow the

B3008 	CLEANED AREA PROBABILITY 1980 POST-STRATIFICATION
	WEIGHT.
	This variable will post-stratify the cleaned area probability
        sample to the household totals and regional distribution of
        the 1980 Census.  It is approximately equal to B3003 times
        B3007 (the post-stratification was changed slightly).  This
        variable times B3002 (divided by 10,000) is the variable used
        to weight the data presented in the September 1984 and
        December 1984 Federal Reserve Bulletin articles on the 1983
        SCF.  The average value of this weight is 15,496.5 for the

	This variable will post-stratify the cleaned area probability
        sample to the household totals by region in the 1983 CPS.  It
        is approximately equal to B3004 times B3007.  The average
        value of this weight is 16,217.9 for the 3,665 observations in
        the cleaned sample.

	This variable is equal to the non-response adjustment factor
        weight (B3002) times the post-stratification weight (B3009).
        THIS IS THE RECOMMENDED WEIGHT TO USE WITH THE CLEANED AREA
        PROBABILITY SAMPLE.  This weight will blow the 3,665
        observation area probability sample up into the aggregate
        (including Alaska and Hawaii) U.S. household population as
        measured by the 1983 CPS.  The average value of B3010 is

B3011 	INCLUSION ERROR EXPECTATION.
	This variable is the expectation of the underlying latent
        variable error in the cleaned area probability sample probit
        inclusion equation conditioned on an observation appearing in
        the cleaned sample (the Mills ratio).  Use of this variable as
        an independent regressor in estimating analytic models may at
        least partially correct for sample selection bias.

B3012 	HIGH-INCOME SAMPLE WEIGHTS.
	This variable is given only for the high-income sample and
        gives relative sampling weights within that sample as computed
        by the IRS and the Office of Tax Analysis.  This weight should
        generally be the one used when performing analysis using only
        the high-income sample.  B3012 takes on only nine different
        values ranging from 60 to 2,533.  The nine different classes
        reflect the original sampling frame and are based primarily on
        income.  The mean of B3010 is 1,280.34.

B3013 	FULL SAMPLE PSU CODE.
	This variable gives a unique sampling cell number to all
        observations in the sample.  This variable can be used in
        forming weights.  Values 1 through 9 are the nine cells in
        B3012 for the high-income observations.  The remainder
        indicate area probability sample PSUs.  Values 10 through 22
        are self-representing PSUs.  Values 23 through 54 are PSUs
        primarily in SMSAs and urban areas.  Values 55 through 84 
        imply PSUs primarily in rural counties.

B3014 	FULL SAMPLE SRC COMPOSITE WEIGHT.
	This weight combines the non-response weight (B3002), the 1980
        post-stratification weight (B3003), high-income weights
        (B3010), and an income-based adjustment to mesh the full area
        probability sample with the high-income sample.  The income
        adjustment is very slight for those area probability sample
        observations with incomes below $50,000.  Area probability
        sample observations in higher income strata will have a much
        more significant reduction in their weight.  The high-income
        sample weights are essentially the same as B3012 times 2, with
        a slight population adjustment.  B3014 will blow the full
        sample up into the aggregate 1980 U.S. household population.

B3015 	FULL CLEANED SAMPLE SRC COMPOSITE WEIGHT.
  	This variable is identical to B3014 except that it applies to
        the cleaned area probability sample and uses the 1983
        post-stratification weight B3009.  This is the weight that was
        used for the March 1986 Federal Reserve Bulletin article. 

	xxxxx. weight (182 to 56,264)
	    0. excluded area probability sample observations (159 cases)


B3016 	EXTENDED INCOME FRB WEIGHT.
	This is a full sample weight which should be similar to B3015
        in use.  It was constructed by post-stratification to the 1982
        IRS tables using extended income (see the summary for a
        description).  THIS IS THE RECOMMENDED FULL SAMPLE WEIGHT.
        The total number of implied households is 83,917,975, with a
        mean weight of 20452.8  No missing values.

B3017	REVISED SRC AREA PROBABILITY WEIGHT.
	This variable is the revised SRC weight as of 1987.  It takes
        into account the removal of the 159 excluded area probability
        cases, and post-stratifies to July 1, 1983 Census population
        figures.

B3058 (S,#1)	successfully coded (B3031 or B3053 coded 1).  Both head and
B3063 (S,#2)	spouse could have up to four different pension plan sequence
B3068 (S,#3)	IDs.  This variable corresponds to the variable V2 (SEQ #)
B3073 (S,#4)	in the Provider Survey file.

B3064 (S,#2)	have up to four different Pension Plans IDs, although only one
B3069 (S,#3)	pension provider contact was made for each individual.  This
B3074 (S,#4)	occurred because some pensions had multiple plans and
                parts.  This variable correspondes to the variable V1
                (CODING ID) in the Provider Survey file.  If the code
                is between 1 and 2,999 then it indicates that the plan
                is a defined benefit plan.  If the code is between
                3,000 and 4,999 then the plan is a defined benefit
                plan.  If the code is 5,000 or over then it signifies
                a mixed defined benefit/contribution plan.

B3121 	STATE.
	Observations from only 37 states (plus D.C.) are included in
        the survey.  This code is given to help facilitate data
        matches.  The individual state data, however, are not
        representative and should not be used to represent the state.
        The SCF was designed to be representative for a unit no
        smaller the four census regions of the country subdivided into
        urban and rural.  Use of individual state data, therefore, may
        lead to very misleading results.  Some states, for example,
        are represented only by rural sampling units, and others by
        only urban sampling units.  The code given is the same as the
        census FIPS code.  Derived from actual location of sample

                                Respondent

B3122 	SURVEY RESPONDENT.
	This is the individual with whom the survey was conducted
        (though others may have been present at the interview and also
        supplied answers).  For dwelling units with multiple
        individuals the selection of the survey respondent followed
        the procedures described in the summary.  Briefly, the interviewer
        determined the "economically dominant" household member.  This
        was the person that owned or rented the home, or provided the
        most income.  Economic dominance was sometimes difficult to
        determine, but generally implied the main breadwinner or the
        most economically active.  In the case of ties, the household
        member closest to age 45 was selected.  The family of the
        economically dominant individual (all household members
        related to them by blood, marriage, or adoption) was the
        survey unit (primary family).  The survey respondent was the
        economically dominant individual or their spouse, whichever
        was determined to be the "most knowledgeable about family
        finances".  The variable coded here indicates whether the head
        (husband, if married) or spouse (wife) was the actual respondent.

	UNIT/DWELLING.
	This includes all persons in the primary family, plus any
        other unrelated non-family household members who share the
        same dwelling unit.  Persons listed here thus correspond to
        members of what the Census Bureau refers to as the household
        (or group quarters) and SRC calls residents of the household unit.
        Individuals are included as residents of the household unit if:
        (1) it wa their usual and only place of residence (even if
        absent at the time of the interview); or (2), he/she was
        physically living in the household unit at the time of the
        interview and a place of residence was maintained for them there (thus
        he/she could have other residences).  A listing of the individuals
        living in the household unit is given in the variables (B3125
        - B3154).  Information is available for each individual on
        their age, sex, membership in the survey household, and
        relationship to the head (husband, if married) of the primary family.

                           HOUSEHOLD INCOME

     Missing data on income was one of the most serious imputation
problems for the survey (about 13% were missing total income).
Imputations for the Income Section were done in a number of different
ways.  General procedures were as follows.  If only total income was
missing it was imputed as the sum of the parts.  If only one part of
income was missing, but the total was reported, the part was
calculated as the difference.  In all other cases the individual parts
of income were imputed (where missing), and total income imputed as
the sum.  If both asset values relevant for income imputation and
income components were missing they were imputed simultaneously using
an iterative procedure.  This technique builds maximum likelihood
estimates of the covariance matrix of the set of imputed variables
under the assumption that they are jointly normal and missing randomly
conditional on the other variables.  Actual imputations follow from
the conditional expectation of the missing variable (computed from the
estimated covariance matrix) and a randomized error.  More specifics
on the information used in computing the imputations is given below.
All high-income sample imputations were done separately. 


                   1982 Gross (Pre-tax) Income Totals

B3201 	TOTAL 1982 GROSS (PRE-TAX) HOUSEHOLD INCOME.
	This variable is the reported total household income.  It will
        differ from the sum of the components of income (B3202) if
        answered that way by respondents.  However, if the sum total
        differed from the reported total by less than $300 the total
        was set equal to the sum.  All missing values were imputed.
        Imputations by the procedures described above.

        listed below (B3205 + B3206 + B3207 + B3208 + B3209 + B3210 +
        B3211 + B3212 + B3213 + B3214 + B3215 + B3216).  It can differ
        from the total provided by the household (B3201) as explained
        above.  All missing values were imputed.

B3204 	CODED VARIABLE FOR HOUSEHOLD INCOME BY DECILES.
	This variable is computed from total 1982 household income
        (B3201).  Each category represents 10% of the weighted (by
        B3016) survey households.  The cleaned sample composite weight
        was used.  The weighted median income was $19,523.  The 2% lower 
        and upper bounds were $2,615 and $99,000; and the 1% upper and
        lower bounds were $1,603 and $142,000.

                       Individual Income Components

B3205 	INCOME IN WAGES AND SALARY.
	All missing values were imputed.  This variables was the major
        imputed income component.  Where possible this variable was
        imputed by head and spouse annual wages reported in the Job
        Section deflated to 1982 dollars.  If wage data were missing
        (or of the previous job if there was a job change in 1982) the
        wage data was first imputed, then used for the income
        imputation.  Wage imputations were accomplished by matching
        the March 1983 Bureau of the Census Current Population Survey
        average log-wages for persons of the same sex, race, age, and
        3-digit occupation and adding a random error term.
        Imputations were done on a per-wage hour basis and adjusted
        for hours per week and weeks per year.  If multiple job
        information was available for an individual, it was used in the
        imputation random term as part of a "random effect" designed
        to have the same intra-person correlation as the portion of
        the sample with complete information.  For some self-employed
        persons, wage data were moved to the business income component 
        (B3206).  The high-income sample imputations did not use the
        CPS match.  Instead the high-income sample itself was used to
        match by occupation and age with randomization.

B3206 	INCOME FROM A PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE, BUSINESS, OR FARM.
	All missing values were imputed.  Imputed from the Business
        Section reported income when available or wage income reported
        in the Job Section for self employed persons.  If wage income
        was missing for self employed persons, it was imputed first
        using the above procedure.  In a few cases, the value of the
        business variables were computed first, and an income yield
        estimated from a log-regression.  For some self-employed
        persons some or all wage/salary income was moved to business
        component.  The high-income imputations were done separately.

B3207 	INCOME FROM NON-TAXABLE INVESTMENTS SUCH AS IRAS
	OR MUNICIPALS
	All missing values were imputed.  If asset values were
        available, income was computed assuming yields equivalent to
        average 1982 yields as reported from various sources.  These
        were a yield of 12.204% on IRAs or Keoghs (calculated from 
        the Federal Reserve Bank Functional cost analysis file); 7.77%
        for all-saver certificates ( 70% of the average one year
        t-bill rate as given in the Federal Reserve Bulletin); 6.86%
        for tax-free mutual funds (average tax-free mutual fund yields
        as reported in Donahues); and 11.66% for state and local municipal
        bonds (Buyer bond index average yield as reported in the
        Federal Reserve Bulletin).  This component was imputed jointly
        with assets in some cases using the method described
        previously.  Some reported values were adjusted as some respondents
        gave the entire value of their IRAs as tax-free income
        (because it was sheltered).

B3208 	TAXABLE INTEREST INCOME.
	All missing values were imputed.  If asset values were
        available, income was computed assuming yields equivalent to
        average 1982 yields as reported from various sources.  These
        were a yield of zero on regular checking; 2.337% on NOW,
        sweep, or SUPER NOW (assumed to be regular NOWs in 1982 since they
        were not available until January 1983) accounts (calculated
        from the Federal Reserve Functional Cost analysis file);
        11.084% on short-term CDs (average 6 month t-bill rate as
        reported in the Federal Reserve Bulletin); 12.277% on other CDs 
        (calculated from the Federal Reserve Functional cost analysis
        file); 6% for savings bonds (the 1977 face rate assumed to be
        the average of existing bonds); 5.25% for regular savings
        accounts (the Regulation Q interest ceiling at commercial
        banks, 5.5% was used for those at S&Ls); 12.23% for money market
        mutual funds or Broker call money (average taxable money
        market yields as reported in Donahues); 12.92% for federal
        bonds (the average 3 year bond rate as reported in the Federal
        Reserve Bulletin); 14.94% for corporate or other bonds (average as 
        reported in the Federal Reserve Bulletin); and 10% on notes
        owed by individuals.  Some of the amounts may overstate the
        tax-form income as they represent accrual income rather than
        cash income.  Bond yields in particular may be over stated as 
        asset values were listed at face value.  Interest income was
        imputed jointly with assets in some cases using the method
        described previously.

B3209 	DIVIDEND INCOME.
	All missing values were imputed.  If stock values were
        available, income was imputed assuming a yield equivalent to
        the average Standard and Poors 500 dividend rate of 5.81% in
        1982.  Because of appreciation of average stock values between 
        1982 and the survey date in 1983, current stock values were
        first deflated to their estimated 1982 values before computing
        the income yield.  This implied an actual yield of only 4.98%
        on current value.  Dividend income was imputed jointly with
        assets in some cases using the method described previously.

B3210 	NET GAINS FROM THE SALE OF STOCKS/BONDS OR REAL ESTATE.
  	All missing values were imputed.  If stock values were
        available and the respondent reported a stock transaction in 1982,
        capital gains were imputed using the average 1982 appreciation of the
        Standard and Poors 500 in 1982 (15.8%). Current stock values
        were deflated back to 1982 values using the same method as
        with dividends before calculating the yield.  Capital gain income was
        imputed jointly with assets in some cases using the method 
        described previously.

B3211 	RENT, TRUST INCOME, OR ROYALTIES FROM ANOTHER
	INVESTMENT.
	All missing values were imputed.  Trust income was imputed
        from the value of the trust if given (otherwise it was imputed jointly
	with trust assets using the method described above).  Trust yield was
	estimated using the component structure of the average bank 1982 trust
	assets as given in the FDIC annual report (22.9% stocks, 10.3% real
	estate, 11.6% municipal obligations, 9.8% interest bearing deposits, 
	30.1% U.S.government and other short term obligations, and 5.%
	non-interest bearing and other).  Each component was assumed to have a
	yield as discussed previously implying an aggregate trust yield of
	8.98%.  Trust assets were deflated to 1982 assuming a year-to-year
	appreciation of 12.64% (derived from the stock capital gain) before
	computing the yield.  Land rents were imputed from a within sample
	regression of percent yield given the type and value of property. 
	Some property values were imputed jointly with rents.

	All missing values were imputed.  Imputations were done with
        employment history variables.  The amount of time each
        household was out of work in 1982 was estimated using dates of
        employment.  Unemployment compensation was then calculated
        using the actual formula of the household's state given previous wages
        and time on the job.

	these were missing, they were imputed first using a log- value
        regression with a random term added.  If no specific sources were
        listed, a separate log-value imputation regression for the
        total pension (usually for a non- head/non-spouse household member)
        was used.  In some cases values were moved between this

		and investments including loans, antiques, precious
		metals or art held for investment purposes.
		Respondent thus "self-defined" whether art, for
		example, was for investment or other purposes (in which case it
		presumably is not reported). Moreover, the value listed is that
		assigned by the respondent, with different assessment

     Value of Individual Land Contracts and/or Notes Owed to Household

B3605 (A)	GROSS PRESENT VALUE.
B3620 (B)	This variable is directly answered for all notes, and is the
B3635 (C)	amount still outstanding on the note .  It is a
		household asset.  For land contracts (B3604, B3619, or
		B3634 equals 2), it is directly answered if the land
		contract does not have regular payments.  Otherwise it
		is calculated from the date the land contract is due,
		the payment frequency, the number of original
		payments, the payment size (PAYMENT), balloon size
		(BALLOON), and an assigned discount rate (INTEREST)
		set to the government bond rate at the time of the
		survey (.1085).  The value formula is then:
		VALUE=PAYMENT*((1-1/(1+INTEREST/12)**PAYLEFT)/(INTEREST/12))
                +BALLOON/((1+INTEREST/12)**PAYLEFT) where PAYLEFT is
		the number of payments left.  All missing values were
		imputed. For notes, imputations used a regression of
		log-value with a random term added For land contracts
		payment terms were individually imputed where necessary.

	in the Vehicle Section (B3906 + B3915 + B3924) plus estimates
	of other vehicle value if more than three vehicles are owned.
	Values for the 4th and 5th vehicles were estimated from loan
	balances if the vehicles were financed (these loans would appear in
	the other loan categories and be identifiable as vehicle loans from
	the purpose of the loan).  Some other vehicles were listed in the
	"other asset" section, and their values included here.  Finally, if
	other vehicles were owned but not listed nor financed, the value for
	each was estimated as 75% (for the 4th vehicle) and 65% (for the 5th
	vehicle) of the value of the third vehicle.  These percentages are
	extrapolations from the calculated relationships between the observed
	3 vehicles. All missing values were imputed.

(3) other loans with regular payments, and (4) other loans without
regular payments.  For each category, detailed data were collected on
the terms of up to three loans.  There is some spillover from the
Vehicle Section, with some loans for fourth and fifth vehicles listed
in the "other loan" categories.  In addition, non-mortgage (or third)
loans used for the purchase of the household's house and loans
reported in the "other loans for investment" in Section K are listed
here.  Loans reported in this section should exclude mortgage loans,
loans reported as draws on lines of credit, credit card loans, and
loans from or to businesses owned by the household.

		the number of fulltime years equals the current age
		minus the age at the first job.  For those with both
		full and parttime jobs this variable has one of two
		values which can be determined uniquely: (1) this
		variable plus the number of fulltime years plus the
		number of parttime years equals the current age minus
		the age at the first job; (2) this variable plus the
		number of fulltime years plus the number of parttime
		years equals the current age minus 18 (indicates
		parttime jobs started before fulltime job).  All
		missing values were imputed using education, specific
		job dates, military, children's age, and conditional 
		mean tables with randomization.

		matching the March 1983 CPS average log-wages for
		persons of same sex, race, age, and 3 digit occupation and 
                adding a random error term.  Imputations were done on
		a per-hour wage basis an adjusted for hours-per-week
		and weeks-per-year.   Imputations were done jointly 
                with past jobs, and were designed so that the error
		terms would have a "random effect" with the same
		correlation as the sample with complete information.  If 
                wages were known for some jobs but not all, this
		information was used in constructing the random
		effect, and thus affected all imputations.  For the high- 
                income sample, imputations were made using
		occupation/age tables constructed from the high-income
		observations with good data.  After matching, random
		terms were added during imputation.

                 Calculated Relative Real Wage Growth Variables

     Using the March 1983 CPS survey data, log-wage (annual income) 
was regressed against a constant, age, max(0,age-35), max(0,age-55),
dummies for level of education (high school graduate, some college,
college graduate, and post baccalaureate study -- less than high
school graduate is the omitted category), and dummies for non-white,
self-employment, and less than 20 hours per week of work.  Separate
regressions were run for males and females.  The regressions were also
run separately for each 1980 3 digit occupation code.  This yields
within-occupation expected annual real wage growth rates (abstracting
from economy-wide productivity growth) for three different age spans,
controlling for race and sex.  Predicted values from the regression
also yield the average fulltime annual income by 3 digit occupation
code controlling for age, sex, and race.

		weeks-per-year.  Imputed values were deflated back to
		the year of the job using the aggregate wage index. 
                Imputations were done jointly with for all past and
		current jobs, and were designed so that the error
		terms would have a "random effect" with the same
		correlation as the non-imputed sample.  If wages were
		known for some jobs but not all, this information was
		used in constructing the random effect, and thus
		affected all imputations.  Imputations were not made for the
		high-income sample except in very limited cases

     All current job holders were asked two sets of pension questions.
The first, which is described here, related to primary pension plans.
The second, described in the next section, related to thrift-type or
secondary pension plans.  The taxonomy, however, was self-defined by
the respondent.  If head/spouse was currently covered by a primary
pension plan, all questions in this section were asked.  Otherwise
only the first two questions on coverage were asked.

		specific (adjusted for age) taken from the slopes in
		the CPS log-wage regressions (for high-income
		observations this is assumed to be zero); (2) a Social
		Security Plan II-B assumption of 1.5% annual economy
		wide real wage growth; and (3) a Social Security Plan
		II-B assumption of 4.0% inflation.  The variable is
		computed for all observations where the age of
		retirement (B4553 or B4653) is given or has been imputed.

		the calculated projected final wage.  The variable is
		given as an annual amount except when a lump sum is
		expected (in which case the lump sum amount is given).

		This variable is the expected retirement benefits in
		the first year of eligibility as answered by the
		respondent, expressed as a percent of their projected

		benefits in the first year of eligibility as shown
		above (B4916 or B5016), but with missing values imputed for 
                households where the head or spouse is over age 39.
		Imputations were made using a regression for benefits
		as a percent of final wages (see B4919 or B5019) with a 
                random term added.  The variable is given as an annual
		amount except when a lump sum is expected (in which
		case the lump sum amount is given). 

		xxxxxxx. dollars (100 to 3,000,000)
		     -6. none, covered under plan but don't expect
			 benefits (51/23 cases)

		the first year of eligibility expressed as a percent
		of their projected wages in their final year of work.  All 
                missing values were imputed for households where the
		head or spouse is over age 39.  Otherwise, these
		variables are the same as B4917 or B5017.  Imputations were 
                made using the same regression as B4918 and B5018.

		xxxxx. percentage times 10 (3 to 20,000)
		   -6. none, covered under plan but don't expect
		       benefits (51/23 cases)

		    0. INAP (2576/3576 cases)


B4920 (H)	PRESENT VALUE OF PENSION BENEFITS FROM MAIN PLAN.
B5020 (S)	This variable is measured assuming an annual (or lump
		sum) pension benefit as given above, starting in the
		year of first benefits.  Benefits for that and each 
                succeeding year are adjusted for the probability of
		death and are discounted back to 1983.  Sex-based
		Social Security mortality tables are used to compute the 
                probabilities of death (standard for each year).
		These are capped at 109 years.  Spousal survival
		benefits are assumed to be opted for 75 percent the
		time and are randomly assigned when appropriate.
		Spousal survival benefits are also adjusted 
                for death probabilities.  Benefits are discounted at
		the 1983 long-term U.S. government bond rate of 10.85
		percent.  The variable is currently calculated only 
                for observations where head or spouse is over age 39.

B4927 (H)	PRESENT VALUE OF ALL FUTURE WAGES FOR CURRENT JOB.
B5027 (S)	This variable is computed using the same wage growth
		assumptions as used to compute the wage in the final
		year of the job.  The present value of future wages 
		is computed by discounting the wages of each year back
		to 1983 using the 1983 long-term U.S. Government bond
		rate of 10.85 percent.  This variable is computed 
                for all observations where the age of retirement

B5209 (S)	Code for the variable which follows (B5110 or B5210).
		The following variable is the expected Social Security
		benefit in 1983 if currently receiving benefits. 
                Otherwise it is expected benefits in the first year of
		eligibility.  This variable is the same as B5107 or
		B5207 except for imputations.  Unlike many pension 
                variables, imputations were made for all households
		including those where both head or spouse are under
		40.  If values were missing, code 2 was assigned to B5109 
                or B5209 and imputations were made for Social Security
		benefits as a percentage of final pay in B5110 or
		B5210.  Further adjustments were made for some persons 
                expecting to receive Social Security on their own

B5111 (H)	PRESENT VALUE OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS FROM
B5211 (S)	EXPECTATIONS.
		This is measured assuming an annual benefit as given
		in B5110 or B5210 starting in the year of first
		benefits (or 1983).  Benefits for that and each
		succeeding year (adjusted for probability of receipt)
		are discounted back to 1983.  Sex-based Social
		Security mortality tables are used to compute the
		probabilities of dying each year and/or living to
		receive any benefits.  These are capped at 109 years. 
                Spousal benefits are also assumed at 50 percent of the
		primary benefit if a spouse is present and does not
		expected Social Security benefits on their own earnings. 
		Spouse mortality tables are also used for these
		calculations.  Benefits are discounted at the 1983
		long-term U.S. Government bond rate of 10.85 percent.  No 
                missing values.

     Data on number of years on social security jobs, wage rates for
each known job, estimates of retirement dates, and dates of starting
benefits were used as inputs to Social Security formulas to compute
benefits.  These have currently been computed for all observations
where head or spouse is over age 39.

B5116 (H)	PRESENT VALUE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX LIABILITY.
B5216 (S)	A calculated value based on current job wage.  All
		persons were assumed to work continuously until their
		stated age of fulltime retirement, and then parttime 
                until their stated age of final retirement.  All
		persons were assumed to retire no later than 72 or age
		+ 1 if currently over 72.  Persons not currently working and 
                over 50 were assumed not to work again.  Wages were
		calculated by projecting current wages by the same
		method used to calculate final wages.  Wage growth was 
                assumed to have three components: (1) occupation
		specific (adjusted for age) taken from the slopes in
		the CPS log-wage spline regressions; (2) a Social
		Security plan II-B assumption of 1.5 percent annual
		economy wide real wage growth; and (3) a Social
		Security plan II-B assumption of 4.0 percent
		inflation.  Parttime years (if currently working
		fulltime) were assigned wages equal to 1/2 the projected 
                fulltime wages or the maximum amount allowable for
		full benefit receipt allowed by Social Security,
		whichever was smaller.  The Social Security tax liability was 
                computed used legislatively planned tax rates
		(employer and employee) and maximum coverage.  No
		missing values.

B5117 (H)	SOCIAL SECURITY AIME.
B5217 (S)	Average Indexed Monthly Earnings used as the basis of
		computing the Social Security benefit base.  The
		variable is the average covered Social Security 
                earnings per month (including zeros) for all years
		from 1951 or age 22 (which ever is later) to age 60.
		These are indexed by a social security wage index to the 
                year respondent is 60.  Years after 60 can be
		substituted at nominal value.  The five lowest years
		are dropped before an average AIME is computed.  These 
                procedures are mimicked using the SCF data on job
		earnings and future retirement plans to estimate an
		AIME value.  Past and current job wages are projected back 
                (and forward) to estimate earnings for each known year
		of work.  These projections assume within-occupation
		real wage adjustments as taken from the CPS regressions 
                (see past/current job), and economy-wide productivity
		growth and inflation as as occurred or is projected to
		occur under the Social Security plan II-B.  Other 
                years of unknown jobs are filled in with terms from
		the closest known job to fill in the total number of
		Social Security covered years.  Wages are then capped at 
                the actual or projected social security maximum and
		minimum coverage amounts.  The AIME was then computed
		using actual or projected Social Security wage indices. 
                The variable is currently estimated for all persons
		projected to have future Social Security benefits
		based on their own earnings for observations where head 
                or spouse is over age 39 who are not currently
		receiving benefits.

		    0. currently receiving benefits, INAP (1207/2574 cases)


B5118 (H)	SOCIAL SECURITY PIA.
B5218 (S)	Primary Insurance Amount on an annual basis.  The PIA
		is the basis of the calculation of Social Security
		benefits.  It is computed from the AIME.  In 1982 the
		monthly PIA was computed as 90 percent of the first
		$254 of AIME plus 32 percent of the next $1274 plus 15
		percent of the amount above.  Calculations here take
		account of legislatively planned changes in this
		formula.  The PIA is currently computed for all
		non-receivers projected to have future Social Security 
                benefits based on their own earnings for observations
		where head or spouse is over age 39.

		xxxxx. dollars (126 to 62,097)

B5119 (H)	COMPUTED SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IN 1983/1ST YEAR
B5219 (S)	ELIGIBLE.
		This variable is the 1982 benefits as reported (or
		imputed) adjusted to 1983 levels (B5110/B5210) for
		those currently receiving benefits.  If it appeared that 
                the recipiant was receiving spousal benefits which
		were included in B5110 or B5210 then this variable
		represents only that share of current benefits calculated to 
                accrue to the primary recipiant.  The remaining
		portion of B5110/B5210 was placed in B5223/B5123.  An
		adjustment was also made to this variable if it
		appeared that the recipiant's benefits had been
		reduced because of work.  In this case (only about 20
		cases were affected) B5119/B5219 reflects the full
		benefit.  For those not currently receiving benefits
		but expecting them in the future based on their own
		earnings B5119/B5219 is computed from the PIA and
		stated age of drawing first benefits according to
		Social Security formulas.  It is given in nominal dollars. 
                Currently computed for all observations currently
		receiving benefits and for observations where head or
		spouse is over age 39 and future benefits are expected. 

		xxxxx. dollars (101 to 69,549)

B5120 (H)	COMPUTED PRESENT VALUE OF OWN SOCIAL SECURITY
B5220 (S)	BENEFITS.
		This is measured assuming an annual Social Security
		benefit as given above starting in the year of first
		benefits (or current).  Benefits for that and each
		succeeding year (adjusted for the probability of receipt) are
		discounted back to 1983.  Sex-based Social Security
		mortality tables are used to compute the probabilities
		of dying each year and/or living to receive any
		benefits.  These are capped at 109 years.  Benefits
		are assumed to grow each year at the Social Security
		plan II-B inflation assumption of 4 percent.  Benefits
		are discounted at the 1983 long-term U.S. government
		bond rate of 10.85 percent.  Currently computed for
		all persons projected to receive benefits based on
		their own earnings for observations where head or
		spouse is over age 39 and all other observations 
                currently receiving benefits.

		xxxxxx. dollars (463 to 194,701)

		     0. INAP (494/2379 cases)


B5121 (H)	AGE AT WHICH SPOUSAL BENEFITS FIRST DRAWN.
B5221 (S)	This is a calculated variable.  It is an estimate of
		the age at which the individual started receiving
		Social Security Benefits (or will receive such
		benefits) on the basis of their spouse's earnings.
		This variable will be zero if 
                no spousal are expected (such as when the individual's
		own benefits are larger than their spousal benefits).
		This variable is currently computed for all persons 
                projected to receive benefits for observations where
		head or spouse is over age 39 and all other
		observations currently receiving benefits. 

		xx. age (45 to 87)

		 0. no spousal benefits, INAP (2477/1657 cases)


B5122 (H)	AGE AT WHICH WIDOWS BENEFITS FIRST COULD BE DRAWN.
B5222 (S)	This is a calculated variable.  It is an estimate of
		the age at which the individual could start to receive
		Social Security widows benefits upon the death of
		their spouse.  This variable will be zero if widows
		benefits could never be drawn.  This variable is
		currently computed for all persons projected to receive 
                benefits for observations where head or spouse is over
		age 39 and all other observations currently receiving benefits.

		xx. age (14 to 74)
		-9. NA, not computed (7/16 cases)
		 0. no widow benefits, INAP (2378/1635 cases)


B5123 (H)	SPOUSAL BENEFIT IN FIRST YEAR ELIGIBLE.
B5223 (S)	This is a calculated variable.  It is an estimate of
		the benefit that the individual would receive in the
		first year he/she is eligible for spousal benefits 
                (or 1983 if currently receiving benefits).  For
		current recipiants this variable plus B5119/B5219 of
		their spouse will generally equal B5110/B5210 of their spouse. 
                This variable will be zero if spousal benefits could
		never be drawn.  This variable is currently computed
		for all persons projected to receive benefits for 
                observations where head or spouse is over age 39 and
		all other observations currently receiving benefits.

		xxxx. dollars (1 to 62,097)

		   0. no spousal benefits, INAP (2630/1787)


B5124 (H)	COMPUTED PRESENT VALUE OF SPOUSAL SOCIAL SECURITY
B5224 (S)	BENEFITS.
		Computed using the same form as the present value of
		primary benefits, adjusted for both mortality tables.
		This variable represents the spousal and widowed 
                benefits received by the individual (thus that for the
		head is based on the earnings of the spouse).  Also
		included are benefits currently being drawn (as given
		in B5123/B5223) and deemed to be current spousal
		benefits.  This variable is currently computed for all
		persons projected to receive benefits for observations 
                where head or spouse is over age 39 and all other
		observations currently receiving benefits.

                           CREDIT SHOPPING

     Respondents were asked about their most recent purchase of a
durable good or home improvement costing more than $500 and occurring
within the previous year (if any).  If he/she had made such a
purchase, details were collected on the method of payment he/she had

but information provided in the Vehicle or Consumer Loan Section
indicated that he/she had.  In these instances data was filled in
here, Credit Shopping Section, reflecting the purchase.

                   ECONOMIC DATA FOR HOUSEHOLDS' GEOGRAPHIC AREA

     Economic data were collected from census tapes for the county and
SMSA (when applicable) where the household was interviewed.  Data were
drawn from the Census publication, "County and City Data Book 1983,"
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1983.  A variety of items were collected at
the county level reflecting the 1980 Census and some economic
information for 1982.  Only population was collected at the SMSA
level.  These data are supposed to be reflective of the household's
economic environment.  For some counties though, such as Los Angeles,
the county may be too large to give a meaningful indication of the
household's particular environment.  There is a fair amount of
dispersion in these variables as households in the SCF were located in
132 different counties and 59 different SMSAs.  No geographic
information is given for the high-income sample.
