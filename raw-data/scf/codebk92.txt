Subject: Description of the Final Release of the 1992 SCF

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This codebook serves as the authoritative guide to the variables
included on the final public version of the 1992 SCF dataset.
However, not every variable included in this codebook is actually in
the public use dataset.  Among other things, the dataset does NOT
include most variables related to the sample design, details of
geography, or the 3-digit industry and occupation codes.  The
authoritative list of the variables included is given at the end of
this documentation.  Please consult that list to determine whether a
given variable is available to you.  For a general overview of the
findings of the 1992 SCF, see Arthur Kennickell and Martha
Starr-McCluer, "Changes in Family Finances from 1989 to 1992: Evidence
from the Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin,
October 1994.

In addition to this file, the full public dataset consists of three
other pieces.  The main dataset, which contains most of the survey
variables, is a 374 megabyte file (stored as a SAS transport file).
A file of of 32 megabytes contains 999 replicate weights and
multiplicity factors intended to be used for variance estimation.
Other documentation is available from
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/92/scf92home.html.

The main data values are stored using variable names corresponding to
the numbers given in the codebook below prefixed by an "X."  We have
tried, insofar as it was possible, to retain the variable numbering
system used for the 1989 SCF.  Each of these variables in the main
dataset has a "shadow" variable that describes--in almost all
cases--the original state of the variable (i.e.,  whether it was
missing for some reason, a range response was given, etc.).  An
exception is reported values which have been imputed or otherwise
altered to protect the privacy of respondents (see below).  Such
values are not flagged in any systematic way.  Users who so desire may
use the shadow variables to restore the data to something very close
to their original condition.  The shadow variables have the same
numbers as the main variable, but have a prefix of "J."  A list of the
values  taken by the shadow variables follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitions of the "J" Variables (1992 version)


0  = value reported on original tape (possibly altered during editing,
     but no evidence on problem sheets to this effect -- NOTE: problem
     sheet information is not comprehensive).

1  = question is inapplicable for R (e.g., R has no checking account
     so value of checking account is coded as zero -- NOTE: there are
     no zeros in the dataset other than such values).

2  = data moved from another location (not including re-arranging
     columns in a grid); data moved from another location and added to
     data already at new location (e.g., wage income from spouse
     reported in independent adult part of section Y added to data
     reported for R in Section T).

3  = data provided for a question with a branch structure, but not
     known which branch data should be in (e.g., AGI given, but filing
     status unknown).

4  = evidence that data imputed from marginal notes.

8  = recode of survey variables, no missing values in antecedents.

9  = recode of survey variables, insufficient data collected to
     compute value, not imputed.

10 = part of reported value reported elsewhere and edited out here
     (e.g., wage income of NPEU member also reported at X5701 along
     with income of PEU resulting in J5702=10) or entire reported
     value reported elsewhere  and edited out here (e.g., all of wage
     income of NPEU member  reported at X5701 resulting in X5701=5,
     J5701=10, X5702=0 and J5702=14).

12 = in case of regular installment loans where term is DK, non-missing
     typical payment moved to monthly payment section.
 
13 = coded value overridden after editing completed
14 = value set to inap given hard-code decision (12, 13 or 15)
15 = hard-coded imputation determined during cleaning.
16 = other reassignment resulting from cleaning that overrides
     reported data (e.g., the cleaning of the institutions grid in
     Section A).
17 = value of originally missing data item implied by other variable(s).

150 = original response was DK.
151 = original response was NA (includes refusals, interviewer errors,
     and missing data resulting from editing decisions).  Does not
     include data missing as a result of missing higher-order questions.
152 = original response missing as a result of missing information for
     a higher-order question (typically a YES/NO cut question).  In
     this case, the higher-order question has been imputed in such
     a way as to render response appropriate.
153 = refused
154 = some, DK how many (see B6).

160 = unresolved data problem (none should remain in final dataset).

179 = data missing because of questionnaire error, or data not collected
180 = recode variable, missing because data not collected for
     sub-group, data to be imputed.
181 = recode variable, some, but not all components originally missing.
182 = recode variable, all components originally missing.

188 = for property value, only assessed value given.

197 = override of reported information with (at least partially)
      imputed data (e.g., number/type of institution in Section A is
      overridden after imputation of institutions to account for new
      institutions).
198 = override of reported/inap. information (e.g., R says has 1 IRA,
      but 2 institution types reported; institution reference refers to
      Section A column, but column inap) -- value set to missing.

199 = used for absent spouse for J104 or J105 when X104 OR X105 < 0.

General instructions for J variable coding for recoded variables:
  When a recoded variable is taken directly from another single X
    variable, it should have the same J variable code.
  When a recoded variable may come from a single variable in the
    original X variables, or as the result of a calculation based on
    some number of X variables, it is important to distinguish the
    information content in the J variables.  When the value is taken
    directly, the J variable should have exactly the same value as
    that for the X variable's shadow J variable.  When some
    calculation is involved, this should be reflected in the J
    variable -- codes 8, 181, and 182.
  When a recode cannot be computed because some part of the underlying
    information was not collected for some subset of cases, the
    recode's J variable should be coded 9 or 180.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The missing data in the survey have been imputed five times by drawing
repeatedly from an estimate of the conditional distribution of the
data.  These imputations are stored in five replicates ("implicates")
of each data record.  Thus, the number of observations in the dataset
(19,530) is five times the actual number of respondents (see below in
the weight section of the codebook for a discussion of the use of
these implicates).  The imputation procedure is described in detail in
"Imputation of the 1989 Survey of Consumer Finances: Multiple
Imputation and Stochastic Relaxation", by Arthur Kennickell.  For a
general discussion of multiple imputation and its uses, see MULTIPLE
IMPUTATION FOR NONRESONSE IN SURVEYS by Donald B. Rubin, John Wiley
and Sons, 1987.  The multiple imputations allow users to estimate the
amount of uncertainty in estimates that is due to imputation.  To do
so, one could make a given estimate separately with each of the five
implicates and compute the standard error of that estimate.  For users
who want to estimate only simple statistics such as means and medians
ignoring imputation error, it will probably be sufficient to divide
the weights by 5.  Users who want to estimate more complex statistics,
particularly regressions, should be cautious in their treatment of the
implicates.  Many regression packages will treat each of the five
implicates as an independent observation and correspondingly inflate
the reported significance of results.  Users who want to calculate
regression estimates, but who have no immediate use for proper
significance tests, could either average the dependent and independent
values across the implicates or multiply their standard errors by the
square root of five.  Users who use the SAS procedure PROC UNIVARIATE
are warned that only the FREQ option will compute a weighted
median--the WEIGHT option will not do so.

Most of the data in the survey are for a subset of the household unit
referred to as the "primary economic unit" (PEU).  In brief, the PEU
consists of an economically dominant single individual or couple
(married or living as partners) in a household and all other
individuals in the household who are financially dependent on that
individual or couple.  For example, in the case of a household
composed of a married couple who own their home, a minor child, a
dependent adult child, and a financially independent parent of one of
the members of the couple, the PEU would be the couple and the two
children.  Summary information is collected at the end of the
interview for all household members who are not included in the PEU.
Throughout the codebook, we refer to the "head" of the household.  The
use of this term is euphemistic and merely reflects the systematic way
in which the dataset is organized.  The head is taken to be the single
core individual in a PEU without a core couple.  In a PEU with a
central couple, the head is taken to be either the male in a mixed-sex
couple or the older individual in the case of a same-sex couple.  No
judgment about the internal organization of the households is implied
by this organization of the data.  When the original respondent was
someone other than the person determined to be the head in this sense,
all data (including response codes) were systematically swapped with
that person's spouse or partner.  The variable X8000 indicates which
cases have been subjected to such rearrangement.

Because the SCF sample is not an equal-probability design, weights
play a critical role in interpreting the survey data.  The main
dataset also contains the final nonresponse-adjusted sampling weights.
These weights are intended to compensate for unequal probabilities of
selection in the original design and for unit nonresponse (failure to
obtain an interview).  The weight (X42001) is a partially design-based
weight constructed at the Federal Reserve using original selection
probabilities and frame information along with aggregate control
totals estimated from the Current Population Survey.  The population
defined by the weights for *each implicate* (see above) is 95.9
million households.  This weight is a relatively minor revision of the
consistent weight series (X42000) maintained for the SCFs beginning
with 1989 (For a detailed discussion of these weights, see "Consistent
Weight Design for the 1989, 1992, and 1995 SCFs and the Distribution of
Wealth," by Arthur B. Kennickell and R. Louise Woodburn, Review of
Income and Wealth, Series 45, Number 2, June 1999, pp. 193-215 or the
longer version given on the SCF web site at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  The nature
of the revisions to the consistent weights is described in "Revisions
to the SCF Weighting Methodology: Accounting for Race/Ethnicity and
Homeownership," by Arthur Kennickell (see SCF web site).  A version of
the revised weight has been computed for all the surveys beginning
with 1989, and this variable has been added to the public versions of
the SCF datasets.  A file of associated replicate weights has also
been added.  Users should be aware that the sum of each of the weights
over all sample cases and imputation replicates is equal to five times
the number of households in the sample universe.

The original weight first released with the 1992 data (X41000) follows
the design of the consistent weights exactly.  However, because
there have been some minor changes in the data since the original
release of the final data, the weights changed slightly when the
consistent weights were reestimated as a group.  The original weights
are retained in the dataset for historical reasons.

Although the weights should produce reliable results at the level of
broad aggregates (e.g., net worth and income), it is important to
remember that many of the variables collected in the SCF are highly
skewed in their distribution and that many such variables will apply
to only a relatively small fraction of the sample.  In the SCF group
at the Federal Reserve, we routinely review our calculations for the
presence of overly-influential outliers, and robust techniques are
applied when appropriate.  We encourage other users to exercise
similar care in analyzing the data.

Because we are unable to give users any sample information about cases
in the dataset, they will be unable on their own to compute
reasonable estimates of the sampling variances of their estimates.  To
facilitate such estimation, we have included a file of replicate
weights and multiplicity factors corresponding to X42001.  Using 
detailed information about the original sample design, we selected 
999 sample replicates from the final set of completed cases in a way 
intended to capture the important dimensions of sample variation 
(See Arthur Kennickell, Douglas McManus and Louise Woodburn, 
"Weighting design for the 1992 Survey of Consumer Finances" for
details).  For each survey case and each replicate, the file
contains a weight and the number of times the case was selected in the
replicate.  We computed weights for each replicate using exactly the
same procedures we used for the main weights.  Replicate weights were
computed only for the first implicate of each case.  For most
purposes, users will probably want to multiply the weight times the
multiplicity: in all cases the sum of the weights times the
multiplicities equals the total number of households.  To estimate the
sampling variance of the mean of family income, for example, a user
would estimate the mean 999 times using the replicate weights and
compute the standard error of that estimate.  An estimate of the
standard error due to these two sources is given by the square root of
the sum of the estimated sampling variance and 6/5 times the
imputation variance.  The replicate weights associated with this
release of the data were recomputed along with the main weight to
ensure consistency with the 1989 and 1995 SCFs.

The ordering of the variables in the codebook often differs from that
in the original questionnaire.  For example, all installment debt
questions are in one place in the codebook, but were asked throughout
the questionnaire.  In some other cases, two sets of questions that
requested the same information of different populations have been
merged (e.g., lines of credit for homeowners and non-homeowners were
originally asked separately, but have been merged in a single set of
variables here).  With the exception of a few variables (e.g., marital
history, where the complex underlying questions have been recoded into
a standard format), the original questions appear in the codebook with
the appropriate variable numbers.  Because question ordering is
important in understanding the effective meaning of many questions,
users of the data are encouraged to consult the copy of the
questionnaire included here for a precise guide to where and how the
underlying questions were asked.

We have not made an effort to include summary variables (e.g., net
worth) in the dataset.  Although it is complicated to construct such
variables, it is our belief that a substantial amount of judgment is
involved in selecting which variables to include, and that analysts
should make their own decisions.  However, at the end of this file, we
have included code to compute net worth according to our routine
definitions.

To protect the privacy of individual respondents, the data in this
release have have been systematically altered by several means to
minimize the possibility of identifying any survey respondent.  For
some discrete variables, small or unusual cells were collapsed as
noted in the variable descriptions below.  Continuous variables were
rounded.  Data were also blurred by other unspecified means.  In
addition, a number of other cases were identified for more extensive
treatment.  Some of these cases were selected on the basis of extreme
or unusual data values.  Other cases were selected at random.  For
each of these cases, a selection of critical variables was set to
missing and statistically imputed subject to constraints designed to
ensure that any distortions induced in key population statistics would
be minimal.  The geographic identifiers included here have been
systematically altered for a subset of respondents by swapping their
locations with those of otherwise similar respondents.

It is important to note that aside from the cell collapsing, there is
no key in this codebook or in the dataset that would allow users to
identify directly either which data items have been smoothed or
otherwise altered, or which cases were selected for imputation of
critical values (that is, the shadow variables in this dataset may not
always reflect the true original status of every variable).  Although
this blurring of the data will have some effect on analysis, that
effect should be negligible in almost every case.  For further details
on the procedures taken to protect the identity of respondents, see
"Disclosure review and its implications for the 1992 Survey of Consumer
Finances", Gerhard Fries Barry Johnson and R. Louise Woodburn.  Users who 
feel that the restrictions imposed on the public dataset are too 
constricting are encouraged to submit written proposals for expanded data
release, and those requests will be given serious consideration in the 
release of data from future surveys.

Under the original numbering system (XX1), the sample design is
apparent from the identification numbers.  Thus, each case included in
the public version of the dataset has been given an identification
number (YY1), which is intended to mask the knowledge of which cases
were drawn from the SCF list sample.  It is not possible to know
with certainty from the information provided in the public version of
this dataset which cases derive from the list sample.  Because we
routinely use the original numbers internally, users who direct
questions to us about specific cases might want to be sure to
emphasize that they are using the external ID number to avoid
confusion.

We have spent many hours searching for errors in the data.  Many
seeming inconsistencies are actually in the raw data and appear to have
no obvious reconciliation (most prominently the fact that X5729--
total income--is not always equal to the sum of the income components).
Other types of inconsistencies may have been induced as a byproduct of
imputation, even though elaborate checks are built into the imputation
routines.  We ask our colleagues who use this dataset to help us find
the remaining resolvable inconsistencies.  Our presumptions is always
that the respondent understood each question and reported accurately,
and that the process of transcription and coding did not distort that
information.  In the relatively small number of cases where other
information led us beyond a reasonable doubt of the validity of the
data, we have changed data, either by altering that value directly
or by setting it to missing and imputing it.

It is likely that some users will have trouble understanding the
organization of the data at first.  If after having framed a focused
question and exhausted all of your local resources your problem
persists, you may call Gerhard Fries  at ((202) 452-2578 or e-mail
m1gxf00@frb.gov) or me ((202)-452-2247 or e-mail
m1abk00@frb.gov)).  We prefer correspondence via e-mail.  While we
would like to be helpful to you, please realize that we have very
limited resources to devote to user services.  We hope that by
persistence, you will almost always be able to figure out what you
need by consulting the questionnaire and the codebook below.

An important exception to this rounding rule is amounts that were
reported in an hourly frequency (e.g., X4112).  If the hourly amount
is greater than $25, then the above rounding rule applies.  Otherwise,
the amount is rounded to the nearest $.10.

WEIGHTS

XWGT        Post-stratification analysis weight as of 9/30/93 (the
            first public release of the data).  WARNING! Because the
            weight is partially data-based (see Kennickell, McManus
            and Woodburn) and the final imputations here differ from
            the intitial values in the first public release, this
            weight is NOT compatible with the final version of the
            data.  It is included here only for historical purposes.

            of the final SCF 92 data.  This variable is included only
            for historical reasons.


X42000      Original Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight.  


X42001      Revised Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight: accounts for
            systemative deviations from CPS estimates of homeownership
            by racial/ethnic groups.  This weight should be used for all
            estimations using the final 1992 SCF data for which weights
            are appropriate.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPLICATE WEIGHTS AND MULTIPLICITY FACTORS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the introduction, there is one additional data file
which contains replicate weights and multiplicity factors to be used in
estimating sampling variances.  The file corresponds to the main
weight X42001.

The replicate weights are of the form WT1Bi, where i=1,...999
The multiplicity factors are of the form MMi, where i=1,...999

Replicate weights with a given index correspond to multiplicity
factors with the same index.

                  set to zero except for a few cases where the person
                  might plausibly be married.  However, it is
                  important to note that because this question was not
                  asked of everyone under 18, this set of married
                  people under 18 is not indicative of the true number
                  of such individuals.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

305         A5.    The next few questions are about the financial
                   institutions that you do business with.

                   With how many financial institutions do you (and your family
                   living here) currently have accounts or loans, or regularly
                   do personal financial business? Include banks, savings and
                   loans, credit unions, brokerages, loan companies,
                   and so forth, but not institutions where you have
                   only credit cards or business accounts.

                   (This variable retains the original value reported
                   by the respondent (contrast 8300 below) except when
                   the original value of this variable was missing.)

                   -1.  NONE
                   .S.  SOME, EXACT NUMBER UNKNOWN


8300        R.      Inferred number of institutions.  When institutions
                   were reported (or in some cases, imputed) after the
                   institution data were collected, except in the case
                   of bank-type credit cards the interviewers
                   were instructed to go back and fill in this
                   information for each new institution.  This
                   procedure worked imperfectly.  This variable
                   takes X305 as its base and adds additional
                   institutions whenever a commercial bank, savings
                   and loan, credit union, or brokerage was reported
                   without a link to the institution data.  Where more
                   there are  than the 6 institutions on which detailed
                   information was collected, the total number of
                   institutions was augmented as appropriate.  In
                   cases where any of the first six institutions have
                   been inferred, the detailed information (location
                   and how R does business) has been imputed.

NOTE: THERE MAY BE SOME DEVIATIONS FROM THE STRUCTURE OF INAPPLICABLE

INFORMATION LINKED FROM 1992 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY BY OCCUPATION CODE


8112 (R)    R:    Average for occupation group of fraction of last 52
8113 (S)          weeks worked; multipled by 10

8114 (R)    R:    Average for occupation group of hours worked per year
8115 (S)          in 1992; multiplied by 10

8116 (R)    R:    Fraction of occupation group unemployed in 1992;

8169 (R)    R:    Unconditional mean wage for occupation group in 1992
8170 (S)

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working 20 or fewer hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS to identify the
           coefficients.

INFORMATION LINKED FROM 1992 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY BY OCCUPATION CODE
FOR PRIOR JOB

8171 (R)    R:    Unconditional mean wage for occupation group in 1992
8172 (S)

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working 20 or fewer hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS to identify the
           coefficients.

                   inheritance, or been given substantial assets in a trust
                   or in some other form?                                     

                   1.  YES  (Include if mentioned, inheritances to
                       R's resident "dependent" children--if not from R

5802        X2.    How many of these have you (or your
                   [husband/wife/partner]) ever received?

                   0.  Inap. (Never received inheritances)


8357        Value of X2 reported by the respondent.

            Often respondents reported that a property, business, etc
            was inherited or was acquired as a gift, but the asset was
            not reported in the summary inheritance questions in
            Section X.  A set of rules was used to incorporate these
            assets in the summary measures.  For each asset the
            respondent reported as an inheritance/gift each
            inheritance/gift/trust in Section X was examined to see if
            there was a plausible match.  When no match could be made,
            the asset was put into the next empty data field in the
            summary measures.  Where data needed to be moved and all
            four summary positions were already used, the additional
            values were added to the fourth position.  All imputations
            were conditioned on available parital information.
            To determine which variables were added it is only
            necessary to compare X5802 and X8357.  If X8357 < X5802 then
            the positions higher than the value of X8357 were added.
            To determine whether additional amounts were added to the
            mop-up variable X5818, compare X5818 with the original
            value of that variable given by X8187.  In all cases, flag
            variables X8183-X8186 indicate which assets, it any, were
            linked with or added to the amounts in the summaray
            inheritance variables.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

301         A1.    I'd like to start this interview by asking you about your
                   expectations for the future.  Over the next five years, do
                   you expect the U.S. economy as a whole to perform better,
                   worse, or about the same as it has over the past five
                   years?                                                     

                   1.  BETTER 
                   2.  WORSE 
                   3.  ABOUT THE SAME 


302         A2.    Five years from now, do you think interest rates will be
                   higher, lower, or about the same as today?                 

                   1.  HIGHER   
                   2.  LOWER    
                   3.  ABOUT THE SAME


303        A3.    Over the next five years, do you expect your total
                   (family) income to go up more than prices, less than
                   prices, or about the same as prices?                       

                   1.  UP MORE  
                   2.  UP LESS  
                   3.  ABOUT THE SAME


304         A4.    Over the past five years, did your total (family) income
                   go up more than prices, less than prices, or about the
                   same as prices?                                            

                   1.  UP MORE

401         B1.    Now I would like to ask you some questions about how you
                   feel about credit.  In general, do you think it is a good
                   idea or a bad idea for people to buy things on the
                   installment plan?

            B2.    People have many different reasons for borrowing money
                   which they pay back over a period of time.  For each of
                   the reasons I read, please tell me whether you feel it is
                   all right for someone like yourself to borrow money...
402         B2.1   first, to cover the expenses of a vacation trip?           
403         B2.2   next, to cover living expenses when income is cut?         
404         B2.3   (next,) to finance the purchase of a fur coat or jewelry?

406         B2.5   finally, to finance educational expenses?

                   husband/wife/partner) requested by reapplying to the same
                   institution or by applying elsewhere?

                   the lender that you did? Was it because of the location
                   of their offices, because they had the best interest
                   rates, because you were able to obtain many services at
                   one place, because they were recommended by someone else,

BANK MARKET STRUCTURE VARIABLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

           The following variables relate to the structure of the
           banking markets in which the respondent lives.  These
           variables come from files maintained by the Financial
           Structure Section.  This information is matched to the
           survey data at the level of the MSA where possible, or at
           the county level otherwise.


X8460      Geographic linkage variable used in FRB bank structure
           data: values less than 1000 are MSA, and other values are
           10,000*(state FIPS code)+(county FIPS code).

                         REVISED EDITING INSTRUCTIONS

                         GENERAL EDITING INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Recording   1.  FM's must write in the interviews in GREEN ink only.  Editors
                must use RED ink only.  The Editing Supervisors must use BLUE
                pencil and must initial all decisions they make.
                                            
Deleting Items  2.    Never erase an interviewer's entries.  Instead, delete
                      them by circling them out.  The interviewer's entries
                      must always remain readable even after deletion.  Editing
                      marks may be erased if editing changes are made.

Moving Items    3.    When it is necessary to move a response from one part of
                      the interview to another, circle the item out, and enter
                      it in the new place.  Be sure to place a note at the old
                      place stating where the item was moved to and why.  Add
                      another note at the new place stating where the item was
                      moved from.

Explanatory     4.    Explanatory notes should also be made (in addition to
Notes                 item 3 above) whenever a decision is made which
                      might not be apparent to someone
                      reviewing the interview.  THE REASON FOR YOUR
                      EDITING SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR.

Missing         5.    Edit a response missing whenever a question was skipped
Responses             which should have been asked.

The Golden Rule 6.    READ ALL MARGINAL NOTES and the THUMBNAIL SKETCH (on the
                      back page) and utilize the information contained in them
                      in your editing.  If any information from them will be
                      lost due to following the editing instructions, or if it
                      contradicts other information, or you do not know how to
                      incorporate it, see the Editing Supervisor.  WE DO NOT
                      WANT TO LOSE ANY IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONTAINED IN
                      MARGINAL NOTES.

Multiple    7.  If more than one response is given by R, for questions
Responses       where we code only one response, code the first answer
                given (lowest coded response). 

Filter          8.    MAKE SURE FILTER QUESTIONS ARE CHECKED
Questions
                a.    If a filter question was left blank but the
                      questions contingent upon it were answered, you
                      can edit the filter question to agree with the
                      contingent Q's. 
      
                b.    If a filter question was left blank and the questions
                      contingent upon it were also left blank, the filter
                      question should be NA'd, unless the I'wer has circled or
                      underlined a skip instruction at the filter Q indicating
                      which box was meant.  Then the appropriate
                      filter box may be edited in.

                c.    If, however, the filter question was checked and the
                      series of questions contingent upon it were left blank,
                      the filter question should be left as is and the
                      contingent questions that follow should be NA'd.

Ranges and  9.  If a range is given, circle it out and edit it to the midpoint
Rounding        of the range.

Range Card  10.    Whenever Range Card was used, the I'wer should have recorded
                   a letter.  Editors should edit the range card letter to a
                   leading 9, zero fill plus the numerical equivalent of the
                   alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc).

Cents Recorded   11.  If dollars and cents are recorded in amount fields OTHER
                      THAN HOURLY WAGES, circle out the cents portion. 
                      However, if you are using such a number for calculations,
                      use the cents.

                      should record the initials of the person who
                      helped them next to the explanatory note. 

Editors' Problem 13.  The purpose of the "Problem Sheet" is to provide a more
Case Summary          complete description of certain types of problem cases.
                      There is no formal "Problem Sheet".  Use the
                      inside back cover and post-it notes as your
                      "Problem Sheet.  The information will be used to
                      review decisions made, to provide additional data 
                      for the imputation process, and to give a more
                      complete picture of the case than the data alone
                      allows.  Information should be added in all the
                      following circumstances:

                 a.  Whenever there are marginal notes or other volunteered
                     information that is not captured in the editing/coding,
                     especially dollar amounts and including responses to
                     questions that Interviewers asked in error.

                 b.  When a decision has been made that was somewhat arbitrary
                     and could have been made another way using the information
                     provided.  In these cases, all information relevant to the
                     decision should be recorded.

                 c.  Wherever specifically instructed to do so in the Edit
                     Instructions.

                 d.  When requested to do so by the Editing Supervisor.

                 e.  When an item must be NA'd because only "partial"
                     information is known, record the "partial" information
                     which would otherwise be lost.

                 f.  When significant detail is volunteered about assets or
                     debts in "mop-up" questions which will not otherwise be
                     incorporated into the data.

                 g.  When certain "wide" ranges are edited to their midpoints
                     they should also be recorded.  These "wide" ranges are
                     whenever:

                        THE TOP OF              THE RANGE WIDTH
                        THE RANGE IS...   AND   IS AT LEAST...  

                        UNDER 100,000           10,000 or more
                        100,000-1,000,000             100,000 or more
                        OVER 1,000,000          1,000,000 or more

                     Problem Sheets should be written in BLACK PENCIL or INK. 
                     Complicated or complex marginal notes and problems can be
                     xeroxed and attached.  They should be left in the
                     Interview and removed by the check-editor.

Double Counting  14.    Editors need to be continually on the lookout for
                        instances where the respondent has reported the same
                        information twice.  In many cases, a marginal note from
                        the I'wer will signal double-counting; if the note is
                        clear, edit accordingly; if it is not so clear, you
                        will have to use your best judgment and, if necessary,
                        see the Editing Supervisor.  In all cases, where a
                        marginal note leaves significant doubt about whether or
                        not an amount is double-counted, put it on a Problem
                        Sheet, whether your best judgment has led you to edit
                        it out or not.

                 In some cases, you will suspect double-counting only because
                 the same amount occurs in two different places.  If the number
                 is a simple, whole amount (such as $2,000), you will only be
                 able to suspect, but do nothing.  If, however, the number is
                 precise (say, $2,212, or better yet, $2,212.48), you may
                 (depending on the circumstances) have clear evidence for
                 double-counting.  See the Editing Supervisor if it is not
                 certain.

                 The question-by-question instructions that follow will include
                 specific instructions where double-counting is likely to occur
                 and should be watched for, so be especially alert in these
                 places.

                 In some cases where double-counting is found, data will be
                 removed from one location; in other cases, the double counting
                 will be allowed to stay in both places.  Cases of special note
                 follow:

                     Section F:           A debt owed by R or other PEU member
                                          to a family
                                                                  (F12-F123)
                                                      business listed at F12-
                                                      F12.3 can also be
                                                      reported at I4-I14.

                     Section R:           Amounts listed as cash settlements at
                                          R98.3 can be double-
                     (R98-R98.5)    counted in other sections.  If the cash
                                    settlement is the source of funds, they may
                                    be validly double-counted as investments or
                                    holdings in accounts.


                     Section Y:           Information that appears in Section Y
                                          as assets or debts of 
                     (Y33-Y40.3)    Financially Independent household members
                                    and in the other sections of the I'w will
                                    be removed from the other sections and left
                                    in Y33-Y40.3, with the exception of the
                                    data on R's home  (Y39-Y39.3).

                     Section X:           Assets that appear in Section X and
                                          also in earlier sections may be left
                                          in both places, since Section X
                                          refers to the source of the assets,
                                          and the earlier sections about how
                                          it's currently held.

                     Section T:           Income amounts that are reported in
                                          other places in the interview and in
                                          Section T should be left in both
                                          places.  Section T asks for all
                                          income and stands independently of
                                          the other sections except where
                                          noted.

General Rule     15.    If it is necessary to split $ amounts in order to move
for Splitting           only a part of a debt, income, or asset to either a
Items                   different place in the Interview or out of the 
                        interview, one should use all available
                        evidence and common sense to decide on the
                        proportions.  If no evidence at all is 
                        available, you should split the amount(s) in
                        equal parts.  IN ALL UNCLEAR CASES, however,
                        you must get the help and advice of the
                        Editing Supervisor or have the Editing
                        Supervisor review the procedure you used and
                        you must write it on a Problem Sheet.


Financially      16.  The information about financially independent adults
Independent           living in the HU is to be edited out of all
Adults                 sections except the HHL and:

                       a.  F9.2, where they can legitimately be
                           recorded as working in R/S's business. 

                       b.  Section Y, where their assets, and health
                           insurance debts are recorded.
                 
Editing          17.    a.    When adding or deleting columns to or
Grids                         from a grid be sure the checkpoints
                              at the bottom of the grid are edited 
                              to reflect the changes made; also
                              change the #'s in the phrase "ONLY
                              ___ LOANS (SAVINGS ACCTS, etc.)" so
                              they agree.

                        b.  After editing out columns, renumber the
                            remaining columns by circling out the #'s
                            in the column headings. 

                        c.  If an item is edited out of a full grid,
                            thus creating an empty column, and there
                            is information entered in the 
                            following mop-up Q's, move it forward into
                           the empty column.  

                 d.  If amounts from the "mop-up" questions following a grid
                     must be entered into a grid column and the amount in the
                     mop-up Q is a lump sum of more than one item, split the
                     amount proportionately.  If unclear how to split, see the
                     Editing Supervisor.  In any case, write up what you did on
                     a Problem Sheet.

                 e.  After all deletions or additions to a grid take care to
                     edit the filter # entered in the box before the grid to
                     the correct new total # of items (i.e., after editing a
                     "tractor" out of the vehicle grid, which also contains a
                     car and pick-up truck, be sure to edit the control box at
                     G25.1 to "2").

"Partners"  18.  For the purposes of this study, a "Partner" is
                 assumed to play the same financial role in a P.E.U.
                 as does a "Spouse" and, for this reason, "Partners"
                 are handled in the Interview exactly the same as
                 "Spouses."  If you, however, think you have found
                 evidence that an Interviewer did not treat a
                 "Partner" the same or that a particular "Partner"
                 might be better considered (financially) a "Friend"
                 or "Roommate", bring the problem to the attention of
                 the Editing Supervisor and write them on a Problem Sheet.

Confidential     19.    If confidential information (such as names,
Info                    names of businesses, etc.) is found 
                        in the interview or in the TN, you should blot
                        it out with a black pen.  If information
                        would be lost because of this, edit
                        non-identifying information in to replace it in
                        green pencil (i.e., if the name of R's
                        business is written in the TN, blacken it out
                        and write in "R's business").

Loan/Mortgage 20.    If a marginal note indicates that a Mortgage or
Payments             Reg. Installment payment reported is not the
                     payment amount agreed on (for example, if 
                     R is "prepaying" on a loan), edit the payment to
                     the payment amount formally agreed to (or NA it
                     if that amount is not known) and write it and the
                     amount actually being paid on a Problem Sheet.

Checking Type of 21. In the grid in Section A, R is asked to enter
Financial Inst.      information on the financial institution he/she
                     does business with in columns labelled 
                     "INSTITUTION #1-#6".  In later grids at Q's D36,
                     D51, D53.8, D64, D69.7, E33, G22, G38, H15, I14,
                     N4, N19 and N24, these "INSTITUTIONS" are
                     referred to in code boxes 01-06.  In these Q's
                     only one box should be checked in each column of
                     the grid.  If more than one is checked you 
                     should edit it to one using the following rules:

                 a.  If category 1-6 and category 11-97 are checked,
                     edit it to only category 1-6 if, on checking at
                     A6, it is found that category 1-6 is the same
                     type of financial institution as category 11-97. 
                 
                 b.  If they are found to be different types, or more
                     than one of category 11-97 boxes are checked, see
                     the Editing Supervisor.

                     IF "FINANCIAL INST" Q IS "CHECK ALL THAT APPLY"

                     However, at B8, B10, N13, N22.3, N40.1 and N45 the
                     instructions in the questions are to "(CHECK ALL THAT
                     APPLY)".  For these you should ONLY make sure that the
                     number of items mentioned at the beginning of the
                     sequenceis not LESS THAN the number of
                     institutions checked.  If they are, then see the
                     Editing Supervisor, unless rule a. above applies.

                     INSTITUTIONS CARD
                     
                     The types of accounts listed on the institutions card will
                     not always correspond to the organization of the data in
                     the questionnaire.  For example, some people may list a
                     money market account on the card, but report the account
                     in the checking account grid in Section N.  Some people
                     list institutions where they formerly held  accounts.
                     However, the card may also be useful as an editing device.
                     For example, a respondent may report that she has a
                     checking account at a commercial bank while the
                     institutions card shows a checking account at an
                     institutions that we know is a commercial bank from the
                     information in Section A.  In some cases, when a
                     respondent is asked directly, he may refuse to tell us if
                     he has some type of asset or debt that he has already
                     revealed to us on the card.  In such cases, you may edit
                     in the asset or liability.


Edit Fractional  22.    At various places in the Interview (D30, D45,
Years                   D58, E9, E25, G16, G32, H10, I8)
                        R is asked to respond with ___# YRS or ___#
                        PYMTS.  If the responses to any of these is a
                        fractional number of years in the # YRS blank
                        (e.g., "1-1/2" YRS), these should be edited 
                        out of the # YRS blank and the corresponding
                        number of payments should be computed and
                        edited into the # PYMTS blank, 
                        as per the following:

                 a.  At D30, E9 and E25 the Q just before or following
                     specifies the frequency with which the payments are  made
                     (i.e., $___ PER ___) and the number of payments would be
                     computed from that (e.g., if "1-1/2 YEARS" paid PER
                     "QUARTER" to "6" # PYMTS).

                 b.  For the rest, the # of payments should be computed
                     assuming one payment per month (e.g., "1-1/2" YRS = "18"
                     # PYMTS).

                 c.  If any marginal notes or information should indicate that
                     some other "regular" frequency of payments is reported
                     than the frequency formally agreed on (because the loan is
                     being prepaid, for instance), then use the frequency
                     agreed upon to compute the # of payments and it should
                     also be noted on the Problem Sheet.

$___ PER ___  23.    Throughout this interview, dollar amounts are asked for as
                     $___ PER___ where the PER frequency is left optional for
                     the R.  These are coded in two variables and the "PER"
                     variable contains codes for "WEEK", "BIWEEKLY", "MONTH",
                     "QUARTER", "YEAR" and "Other-MAKE A CARD" and, in
                     addition, "DAY" when wages are asked for.  Thus, THERE IS
                     NO REASON FOR YOU TO EDIT THESE UNLESS SPECIALLY
                     INSTRUCTED, even if the Q asks for an answer in a
                     different time period than the R answers in (e.g., N49.10
                     asks for "yearly premium"; you should not edit a response
                     of $"20" PER "MONTH").

Grid Control  24.    At the beginning of most of the grids in the
Questions            interview (D53, E2.1, E15, F2, Boxes F4.1, G2,
                     G7.1, G7.1, G25.1, H2, I3, N3, N16.1, N23.1, 
                     R18, R97.1, R98.1 and X2) are large boxes which
                     function as CONTROL BOXES for the grid.  The
                     number in the box should be equal to or greater 
                     than the number of items recorded in the grid.

                 a.  If the grid does not have a set of "mop-up" questions at
                     the end of it, in which more than one item may be lumped,
                     then the number in the grid will match or be greater than
                     the number of items entered in the columns of the grid.

                 b.  If the grid does have a set of "mop-up" questions at the
                     end, then the number in the box must be at least as large
                     as the number of columns in the grid plus the number known
                     to be in the mop-up questions.

                 c.  If you edit items into or out of a grid, you must edit the
                     filter box for it, to keep it consistent with the grid and
                     mop-up questions.

Gift/Inheritance 25.    Throughout the interview (at D11.3, D12.2,
Boxes                   D15.1, D15.3, D15.5, D20, E19, E36.2, and
                        E37.1), when the value of an asset 
                        is asked, a "GIFT/INHERITANCE" checkpoint is
                        included.  Whenever you encounter one of these
                        and marginal notes or information says that the
                        asset, or part of the asset, was a gift or
                        inheritance, you should:

                 a.  Make sure the 1 is circled. 

                 b.  Make sure the value given was the value of the asset when
                     it was received.

                 c.  If an asset was received as a gift or inheritance in
                     parts, at different times, see the Editing Supervisor.

                 d.  If 1 is not circled, editors should circle 2.

Business Debts   26.    In Sections G, H, I, N and at E1-E13.2 you are
and Assets              instructed to edit out "business"
                        debt or assets in order not to double-count
                        them, as they are assumed to be included in
                        Section F.  Whenever so instructed, we mean
                        "business" debts and assets to be defined as
                        follows:  

                 a.  The "business" is a business that R or some other PEU
                     member owns or has an interest in which is included in
                     Section F as an active or passive business.  
                     If R or a PEU member does self-employed work but does not
                     consider it to constitute a "business" (and does not list
                     it in Section F), then any income producing assets they
                     use or debt they incur for it are "personal" and these
                     assets and debts and should be left in.

                     An example of this would be an R who owns a tow truck
                     (which he still owes money on) to do part-time towing, but
                     does not consider that he has a business, so answers F3
                     "NO".  You would leave his tow truck in the Section G
                     grid.

                 b.  The "business asset" should be owned "in the name of" the
                     business rather than being owned as a "personal" asset by
                     the PEU.  Likewise, the business should be liable for the
                     debt rather than the PEU.

                     Thus, if R borrows money for his business in his name and
                     he is liable for it, it is not "business debt."  Also, if
                     R's business owns an asset (like a car), but R uses it, it
                     is a "business asset."

                     NOTE:  Solely owned proprietorships (see F9-4) are
                     particular problems and in general you should consult the
                     Editing Supervisor if you encounter "business" debt or
                     assets for a solely owned proprietorship outside of
                     Section F.

Seasons          27.    If MONTH is NA, but season is given, code: 
                        Winter = 02   Summer = 08   Spring = 05  
                        Fall   = 11 

# of years =     28.    For all Q's asking "# of years", code "01"
less than 1             will include one year or less but will not
                        include "NONE".

              USEFUL DEFINITIONS

      1.      HOUSING UNIT (HU):

              a. A one-family house or half of a two-family house, or
              b. An apartment or flat in an apartment house or other building,
                 or
              c. A trailer or mobile home (as long as it has cooking
                 facilities), or
              d. Living quarters in back of stores, over garages, etc., or
              e. A rooming house.

              We do not sample institutions such as old people's homes,
              sanitariums, convents, military bases, dormitories, etc., which
              contain ten or more unrelated families.

      2.      FAMILY UNIT (FU):  A Family Unit is a group of persons living in
              the same Housing Unit who are related to each other by blood,
              marriage, or adoption.  Couples who are living as married are
              treated as if they were married.  

      3.      PRIMARY ECONOMIC UNIT (PEU):  The members of the FU that includes
              the Respondent, who are Financially Dependent upon the R.  For our
              purposes, the PEU consists of all the people listed in the HH
              Listing Box who are not checked "INDEP" in Column F.
                        LISTING BOX -- P. 1, HHL1-HHL5
                                                                              
FS            INITIAL THE INTERVIEW AT THE TOP LEFT OF PAGE 1     
              
TN            READ THE THUMBNAIL ON LAST PAGE AND Y41 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
              AND TO LOCATE TROUBLE SPOTS IN THE INTERVIEW.  UNDERLINE USEFUL
              INFORMATION IN RED.

HHL           CHECK WHETHER THE INTERVIEW SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN.  If you find
BOX           an interview taken:

              1. where the current PEU did not live in the HU at the time
                 the I'wer first went to the HU (except for list sample
                 cases).

              2. where the R is not a member of the PEU.

              3. at a place which does not fit our definition of a HU.

              Take it to the Editing Supervisor.  The decision whether to accept
              it or not will be made elsewhere.

HHL           CHECK THE LISTING BOX AND EDIT OUT NON-HU MEMBERS
BOX
              1. The listing box should contain all persons living in the
                 housing unit at the time the interviewer first had contact
                 with the household.  

              2. It should not include visitors or persons who are not
                 currently living in the HU. 

              3. Edit out non-HU members (by circling in red) and writing an
                 explanatory note.  Use information from the HHL as well as the
                 rest of the Interview and the TN.  In cases where the
                 situation is complex, the final test is whether or not the
                 person could have, theoretically speaking, been interviewed
                 somewhere else at the time that the interviewer CALLED ON THE
                 HU for the first time.  In order to ascertain the date of the
                 interviewer's first call it is necessary to obtain this
                 information from the Cover Sheet in the Field Control Office. 
                 See a Check Editor or Supervisor for this.  As much as
                 possible, the judgment of the Interviewer should be
                 maintained.  If it is unclear if a person should be included
                 or not and the Interviewer has included them (and thus their
                 financial information), then usually we should include them. 
                 Likewise, if it would mean NA'ing a lot of data because the
                 Interviewer did not not include them, then we shouldn't.

              4. If you edit anyone out of the HHL box you must also edit out
                 any financial information for the person from the interview. 
                 You should take any such cases to the Editing Supervisor and
                 you must write it up on a Problem Sheet.

              5. If you edit any children of R, Spouse or Partner out of the
                 Listing Box you must edit them into Y5-Y5.2 (the number of
                 children of R and Spouse/Partner living elsewhere).


HHL COL D     CHECK MARITAL STATUS AND MOVE SPOUSE/PARTNER TO LINE 2:

              1. Check that the marital status for R and Spouse/Partner is the
                 same -- either both married or both living with a partner (M
                 or P).  If there are any discrepancies, bring them to the
                 attention of a supervisor.

              2.     If R reports "married," but is not currently living with
                     his/her spouse, the R may either be separated or the
                     spouse may be living in an institution, be away in the
                     military, maintain a separate address during the week,
                     etc.

                 a.  If the R and spouse are actually separated, change the
                     marital status and edit the questionnaire to remove the
                     spouse to the degree this is possible and mark the case
                     for review by an editing supervisor.

                 b.  If the spouse is temporarily away or regularly returns, we
                     would like to include the spouse in the questionnaire.
                     Code the spouse marital status using the "7" or "8" code
                     and leave any assets and liabilities reported in the 
                     questionnaire.  If the R does not include all of the
                     assets  and liabilities of the spouse, make the case for
                     review by  an editing supervisor.  Code residence status
                     4 (see below  for explanation).
              
              3. If the spouse/partner is not listed on the second line,
                 renumber the HH members, giving the spouse/partner #2.  Draw
                 an arrow from the S/P to line 2 indicating that the
                 spouse/partner should be entered on Line 2.

              4. NOTE:  "S" means "Separated" (not "single").  "NM" means
                 "Never Married."

              5. If a child/stepchild of R/S is over 18 and marital status is
                 not marked, code it missing.


HHL COL E     PRECODE RESIDENT STATUS

              Read over any marginal notes and use the following code for each
              person in the HHL box.



                             RESIDENT STATUS CODE

      For codes 2-4 and 7, circle out the YES or NO response and enter the new
      code in the middle of COL. E.  For codes '1' and '2', underline the "1" or
      "2" in green.


HHL COL F     PRECODE THE ECONOMIC UNIT

              Code the "economic unit" to which each person in the listing box
              belongs.  Enter the code to the left of the center bar of COL. F,
              under 'FINANC DEPEND'.  Use the following code; R is always coded
              '1'.  

              If it is unclear whether a person is FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT or
              INDEPENDENT or which EU a person should be a member of, see the
              Editing Supervisor.


EU MEMBERS    The debts, assets and income of all PEU members (coded 1) should
be included in
FINANCIAL     Sections A-X and none of them should be included in Y33-Y43. 
Likewise, all
INFO IN       all persons not in the PEU (i.e., in 2nd, 3rd, etc. EU) should
have their finances
WRONG PLACE   reported in Y33-Y40.2 and should not be reported in Sections A-X
              (with the exception of house value and mortgage information to be
              explained later).  Thus, if you edit anyone into or out of the PEU
              or you find any evidence that anyone's finances are reported in
              the wrong place, you must edit them to agree with the HHL box and
              it should be entered on a Problem Sheet.  If there are any doubts
              concerning this issue, you should bring the Interview to the
              Editing Supervisor.


PARTNER       If any Spouse or Partner is marked "FINANC INDEP":
OR SPOUSE
MARKED        1. If it is a partner marked "INDEP" and their finances are
                 clearly reported in
INDEP.               Y33-Y43 and not in Sections A-X the "partner" should be
                     edited to "friend" in the HHL box.  If their finances are
                     included in Sects. A-X and not in Y33/Y43, edit COL F of
                     the HHL box to 'FINANC DEPEND'.

              2. If it is a spouse marked "INDEP", COL F should be edited to
                 "FINANC DEPEN".  In either of the above cases, the Interview
                 should be taken to the Editing Supervisor and a Problem Sheet
                 written up.


UNDER 18      If a person under 18 years old is marked "INDEP":
MARKED
INDEP         1. If it is clear that their finances are reported in Y33-Y43 and
                 not in Sections A-X, leave things as they are.

              2. If their finances have not been included in Y33-Y43, but
                 instead in Sections A-X, edit them to "FINANC DEPEND".
                 SECTION A:  ATTITUDES AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS




A5, A5.11     Check that the number entered at A5 agrees with the number entered
              in the box at A5.11.  If  does not, see the Editing Supervisor.


A5.11         Edit the # INST entered in the box at A5.11 is equal to or greater
              than the number of Institutions recorded in A6-A9 for Columns #1-
              #6.  If R reports more than 6 institutions, the number in this box
              may be greater than 6 even though only 6 institutions will be
              listed in the grid.


A6-A9         FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GRID

              1. Columns should be neither added to this grid nor deleted.  If,
                 however, more than six institutions are entered in the
                 columns, edit those beyond six out.  There should only be six
                 institutions listed in the columns.  See the Editing
                 Supervisor if there is any confusion here concerning which
                 institution R regarded as #1, #2, etc.
      

A7            If R chose more than one response, take the first one in the list.

B6-B10        CREDIT CARD GRID

              1. If R does not know how many cards of a particular type other
                 family members have, or the balance on those cards, the
                 interviewer is instructed to make a marginal note.  Enter this
                 information on a Problem Sheet.

              2. Edit out all credit cards in the name of a business (including
                 businesses that the PEU has an interest).  Do not, however,
                 edit out credit cards in R's or PEU members' names but which
                 may be used for business.

              3. Check Column E credit card type.  If it is clear that a credit
                 card listed in COL E really belongs in one of the other
                 columns, edit the information into its proper location.  Most
                 commonly a store credit card will have been entered here and
                 should be edited to COL B.

                 a.  Telephone cards (other than cards like the  AT&T Universal
                     Card which are a Visa/Mastercard and a telephone credit
                     card) should be removed.


B6,B10        Check the Number of Financial Institutions against the Number of
Bank-Type Cards.           COL A                If there are more institutions
                                                checked at B10 than the # of
                                                accounts entered at B6, see the
                                                Editing Supervisor.



                       SECTION D: HOUSING STATUS (D1-D22)

D1            1. Check that the correct sequence was followed at interviewer
                 checkpoint.  Check ZZ2 and D16 to help in identifying
                 problems.

              2. See farm guidelines, p. 24.


D5            OWNERSHIP STATUS OF FARM/RANCH

              1. Check that R's who live on farms or ranches have gone through
                 the own/rent sequence appropriately.  Look for marginal notes
                 that explain any unusual situations, and bring these to the
                 attention of the supervisor if the sequence marked does not
                 appear to incorporate all information.

              2. If PEU are tenant farmers:   A tenant farmer rents his farm
                 and pays rent in cash.  For people in these classifications,
                 make sure the "RENTS" box is checked at D5.  Check the rent
                 amount given at D17; if it is given as a dollar amount, leave
                 it as is.  If R "doesn't know", edit it to DK.  In either
                 case, write it on the Problem Sheet if the rent, or part of
                 the rent, is not paid in money.

              3. If the "OTHER" box at D5 is marked, examine the response to
                 see if it should be edited to boxes 1-4 only if the proper
                 skips have been followed.  If the response should remain in
                 the 'OTHER' box, write it on a Problem Sheet.


D5.3          Edit as per D19 below.


                             FARM EDIT GUIDELINES


We have arrived at a set of guidelines for handling farms that we think will be
fairly clear in most cases.  The guidelines are:

For farm owners and operators:

      1.      D5.3 (or D10) will contain the value of all the land and
              structures on the farm that the PEU owns; and D20 should be the
              total cost of all the property and structures on the farm that the
              PEU owns.

      2.      Frequently farmland that is not adjacent to the land the home is
              located on is reported in section E.  Such property and any
              associated debt should be moved from the E section to the
              appropriate section D sequences.

      3.      The above assumes that the PEU actively manages a farming business
              that is reported in the F15-F19 sequence.  The amounts in F14 and
              F15 will contain the following:

              F14    Only the value of implements, crops, farm animals, and
                     anything else except the value of the land and structures.

              F15    The amount that was paid for all of the above.

      
              In all cases these items will need to be checked by the Editing
              Supervisor.

For all cases that do not fit the situations outlined above, see the Editing
Supervisor.


D11, D11.5    MOBILE HOMES:

              1. Look for marginal notes that explain any unusual situations,
                 and bring these to the attention of the supervisor if the
                 sequence marked does not incorporate all relevant information. 
                 Write such cases on a Problem Sheet.

              2. If "NEITHER OWNS NOR RENTS" is marked, examine the responses
                 to see if R owns any part of the site or mobile home.  If so,
                 edit D11 and follow-up questions appropriately to agree with
                 the information you have.  If there is any uncertainty about
                 how to code D11, see the Editing Supervisor.



D16-D16.2     HOUSE/APARTMENT/FARMHOUSE OWNERSHIP STATUS:

              1. Look for marginal notes that explain any unusual situations. 
                 If the sequence marked does not appear to incorporate all
                 information, bring these to the attention of the Editing
                 Supervisor.  Write up any problem cases on a Problem Sheet.

              2. If R mentions Homeowners' Association at D16, edit it to '5.
                 TOWNHOUSE ASSOC.'

              3. a.  If the home is owned wholly or partly by a business owned
                     by the PEU (in Section F), see the Editing Supervisor.

                 b.  If R owns the home with people in the household who are
                     not part of the PEU, be sure the value and mortgage
                     reported in Section D corresponds ONLY to R's share.  The
                     entire value of the property and the mortgage are reported
                     in Section Y, Q.39.2 and Q.39.3.


              4. If "R LIVES IN MULTIPLE HU STRUCTURE" is checked at D16.3,
                 check the responses to D18 and D18.1.  

              5. If "NEITHER OWNS NOR RENTS" is checked, read the explanation
                 given at D16.4 and check that the correct sequence was taken.
  
                 a.  If it appears that R owns any part of his/her home, edit
                     D16 to "OWNS OR IS BUYING" and edit the follow-up
                     questions appropriately, using all the information given. 
                     If there is any uncertainty, see the Editing Supervisor
                     and write any problem cases on the Problem Sheet.

                 b.  If R's housing is fully subsidized by the government,
                     including military personnel, edit D16 to "PAYS RENT".


                                  DEFINITIONS


D16.3 In principle, when R lives in a multiple HU structure and R owns more than
      the unit he lives in, we only want the details on only R's unit in Section
      D with the remaining value reported in Section E.  Where possible, edit
      the data in this way. However, particularly for smaller structures
      (duplexes, triplexes, houses with basement or garage apartments), it will
      be virtually impossible to make a separation.  In such cases, make a note
      on the problem sheet and accept the data for the entire structure.
D17-D17.3     IF PEU PAYS RENT:

              1. If R pays for both room and board, edit out the amount paid
                 for board.  If the amount paid is not known, assume half of
                 what is paid is rent.  If this seems unreasonable, see the
                 Editing Supervisor.

              2. We want the rent most recently paid (or due).  For example, if
                 "the rent was just raised to $275, but when the rent was paid
                 last it was $260," edit it to $260 per month.  If R mentions
                 several different rents paid over the past year and gives an
                 average, edit to the rent last paid (or due).



              3. If the rent is shared with other EU's, edit D17 to the PEU's
                 share only.  If several "Independent Adult" roommates share
                 the rent with R and the proportions are unknown, split the
                 total rent equally among them and edit D17 to R's share.  If
                 the situation is more complex, see the Editing Supervisor.

              4. FOR TENANT FARMERS -- see D5.

D17.1         Water is not assumed to be a utility for purposes of D17.1.  If
              "Yes, water" or "only water," edit the response to "NO" 

D17.2         If only stove and/or refrigerator are provided, edit D17.2 to
              "UNFURNISHED" if it is not already so marked.

D17.3         If R "lived here before," moved out and then moved back, edit
              D17.3 to date R moved back this time.  If R lived in another
              apartment in this building or project before moving to this
              apartment, edit D17.3 to date R moved to this apartment.

D18, D18.1    Look for marginal notes here explaining any unusual situations. 
              If it is unclear how such information should be coded, see the
              Editing Supervisor.  Write it up on a Problem Sheet if there are
              any unusual or confusing situations.  Check ZZ2 for clarification.

D19           FOR HOME (FARM) OWNERS:

              1. The house value at D19 should include the part R owns.  For
                 farmers this includes the house, farm buildings, and
                 contiguous farm land.

              2. If R says they have been offered $80,000 but wouldn't take
                 less than $100,000, code the midpoint.

              3. If R has been offered more than the actual value of the
                 property ("I've been offered $50,000, but it's actually worth
                 only $30,000"), code the amount offered.

D19           4. If part of the house is owned by persons with independent
                 finances or with people who do not live in the HU, include
                 only the part of the property actually owned by the PEU.  The
                 total value of the property owned by all people in the HU
                 should be given at Y39.2 when there are HU members with
                 independent finances.  If a part of the house is owned by
                 someone outside the HU, mark the case for review by an editing
                 supervisor.


D20           DATE OF PURCHASE:

              1. In cases where multiple dates are given at D21 (purchase date,
                 the house occupancy date, and/or the date of the mortgage),
                 edit in the date as per the following priorities:
                 Record the uncoded dates on the Problem Sheet.  

              2. If the house was purchased/inherited/built in increments, edit
                 it to the priorities above for the earliest increment of the
                 house itself (not incl. land purchases).

              3. If farmers bought their farm in increments, use the date the
                 earliest part was purchased.

              4. If the house was inherited (the GIFT/INHERITANCE box at D20 is
                 checked), this date should be the date inherited.


D21           If R bought a house furnished, do not attempt to separate out the
              value of the furnishings.  

D22           Add land and house taxes together if they are given separately.
              If the period of taxes is not given, write in "YEAR."

D23           If R reports both "YES, MORTGAGE" and "YES, LAND CONTRACT" at D23,
              check the grid to make sure that at least two columns of the grid
              have been filled out.  If they have, edit D23 to "YES, MORTGAGE"
              and follow that sequence.
              If at least two columns of the mortgage grid have not been filled
              out, see the Editing Supervisor.


D27-D40.1     THE MORTGAGE GRID

              1. Be on the lookout for any unusual or confusing mortgage
                 arrangements which may be problems.  Take them to the Editing
                 Supervisor and, if necessary, write them up on the Problem
                 Sheet.

              2. Mortgages reported in this grid should always be left in
                 unless it is clear:

                 a.  that it is not the home the PEU is currently living in
                     (move these debts to E15-E34, "Other Property");

                 b.  the home the PEU is currently living in is not collateral
                     for the mortgage (these may be moved to D41-D51, D54-D65.2
                     or elsewhere) depending on the purpose and type of the
                     loan;

                 c.  the PEU is not liable for the mortgage.

                 d.  NOTE:  Another exception would be a HOME EQUITY LINE OF
                     CREDIT (see Quick Reference Guide for definition) that was
                     NOT a first mortgage.  These should be edited out of COL
                     B or C for D27-D40 or D41-D51 and moved to D53-D53.9.

                 In all these cases see the Editing Supervisor and the case
                 should be written up on the Problem Sheet.

              3. If it is discovered that the PEU does not own any of the home
                 and are living rent-free, D16 will have to be edited to
                 NEITHER OWNS NOR RENTS, and Section D re-edited.  If R only
                 owns part of the property, only include the part of the
                 mortgage that R is responsible for.  The total amount
                 outstanding on the mortgage that is the responsibility of the
                 R and any people with independent finances should be reported
                 in Section Y, Q.39.3.  See the Editing Supervisor and write
                 this up on a Problem Sheet.

              4. If it is found that the mortgage is partly or wholly assumed
                 or paid for by a business in Section F owned by the PEU, you
                 should see the Editing Supervisor.

              5. If marginal notes indicate that the payments change during the
                 life of the mortgage for reasons other than variable interest
                 or balloon payments (which are handled by the grid), see the
                 Editing Supervisor and put it on the Problem Sheet.  Examples
                 of these would be "negative amortization" or "graduated
                 payments".

              6. Co-ops may have mortgages on the entire building, as well as
                 on the PEU's unit.  If you encounter any such as these, edit
                 them to include only PEU's unit.

D27, D28,     In the case of assumed mortgages, the data in D27, D28, and D30
D30           should be as of the date that the mortgage was assumed by the PEU,
              not the date it was originally taken out by the seller.

D27.1         Beware of confusions between "seller-provided" mortgages (where
              the seller provides the financing for the mortgage and the PEU
              pays the seller) and "assumed" mortgages where the PEU takes over
              the payments from the seller.  For "seller-provided" mortgages,
              D27.1 should be edited to "NO".

D29           If D29 is NA, do NOT compute it from D30 and D31; leave it blank.


D30           1. If D30 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
                 the GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22a.

              2. If "NO SET #" is checked, check D52-D53.10 for possible
                 double-counting.  If double-counting is found, see the Editing
                 Supervisor.


D36           Edit the Type of Institution at D36 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


D37           Precode the purpose of the 2nd mortgage at D37 using the LOAN
              PURPOSE CODE.


D40, D40.1    Check that the D40 and D40.1 boxes are checked correctly after all
              editing of this section is finished.


D41-D51       OTHER HOME LOANS

              1. Watch for cases here which have:

                 a.  HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT loans, which should be in D52-
                     D53.10.

                 b.  2nd and 3rd Mortgages (for which the home is clearly noted
                     as being collateral) which should be in COLUMNS B & C of
                     the D27-D40 mortgage grid;

                 c.  Home improvement loans (purpose clearly stated), for which
                     the home is not collateral, should be in D54-D65.2.

                 If you think you have found any of these, see the Editing
                 Supervisor.  They should be edited to their proper place.  If
                 you find such a loan here double-counted with one in D52-
                 D53.10, the Section I loan grid, or D54-D65.2, edit it out
                 here and leave it in its proper place.  These should be
                 written on the Problem Sheet.

              2. If more than one "other" loan is itemized here, leave the
                 largest (in terms of the amount borrowed) here and move any
                 other to the grid at I3-I15 (where they should be coded "01"
                 for loan purpose).


D45           If D45 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per the
              GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


D51           Edit the type of institution at D51 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


D53           Edit the # LINES OF CREDIT entered in the box at D53 to be
              consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 of the grid
              and D53.10 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.

D53.1-D53.10  THE HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT (HELC) GRID

              1. If a HELC here is double counted in the Mortgage grid at D27-
                 D39, leave it in there if it is the first mortgage; leave it
                 in here if it is not a first mortgage; put it on a Problem
                 Sheet in either case.

              2. Check for Credit Cards which may be included or double-counted
                 here.  They should be edited out of this sequence to Section
                 B.  If they are double counted, remove them from Section B and
                 put the information on a Problem Sheet.  If they can't be
                 separated out of Section B, see the Editing Supervisor.

              3. Edit out any business lines of credit found here.




D53.4         Pre-code the purpose of the loan using the LOAN PURPOSE CODE 

              If the purpose of the loan is coded "10" (to purchase a car),
              check the "owned vehicle" grid (G8-G23) to see if this loan is
              double-counted there.

                 a.  If it clearly is, edit the debt out of the vehicle grid.


                 b.  If it may be, but it is not clear, see the Editing
                     Supervisor.
                     NOTE:  A car used for business purposes (but not owned by
                     the business) may be left here.

D53.8         Edit the type of institution at D53.8 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION
              21.

D53.10           If the PEU has more than three HELC, any money owed on these
                 surplus lines will be entered at D53.10.

D54-D65.2     ADDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS

              1. Check marginal notes to make sure R has not failed to include
                 an addition such as "landscaping", "built a garage", or some
                 other exterior addition which he/she thought should not be
                 included but which is an addition.  If you find such cases,
                 bring them to the Editing Supervisor.

              2. Additions on farms and businesses should be edited out.  But
                 additions on the farmhouse, or that part of a business which
                 contains the PEU's home, should be left in.

              3. If a home was built in increments and an addition seems to be
                 one or more of the increments, take it to the Editing
                 Supervisor.  Building of the home and its cost and loans
                 should not be here.

              LOANS FOR ADDITIONS

              1. If a loan here is clearly collateralized by the house, it
                 should be moved to column 2 or 3 in the mortgage grid.

              2. If you find a loan here that is clearly a Home Equity Line of
                 Credit, it should be moved to D53-D53.10.

              3. Loans here that are double-counted in the mortgage or HELC
                 sections should be edited out here and left in those sections.

D58           If D58 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per the
              GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.

D64           Edit the type of institution at D64 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.

D65-D65.2     If another home addition and improvement loan is at D65-D65.2 and
              marginal notes provide more information on it than can be
              contained in D65.1 and D65.2, move it to the loan grid at I1-I15,
              if there is an available column there.


              LINES OF CREDIT FOR NON-OWNERS ONLY:

D69.7         Edit the type of institution at D69.7 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION
              21--"CHECK ALL THAT APPLY".

D68.1        Check that the # LINES OF CREDIT (LOC) recorded in the
 & D69       blank  at D68d is the same number as is entered in the
             box at D69 on the next page.  If it is not, see the
             Editing Supervisor. 

D69           Edit the # LINES OF CREDIT (LOC) entered in the box at D69 to be
              consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 of
              the grid. 

                 SECTION E: OTHER PROPERTIES, LAND CONTRACTS 


E2.1          Edit the # NOTES/LAND CONTRACTS/MORTGAGES entered in the box at
              E2.1 to be consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3
              of the grid and E13-E13.2 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


E3-E13.2      NOTES/LAND CONTRACTS/MORTGAGES OWNED

              1. Check for double-counting of properties between E3-E11 (sold)
                 and E16-E34.1 (currently owned).  If a property is clearly
                 listed in both places, leave it here and edit it out of E16-
                 E34.1.  If you suspect double-counting but it's not clear,
                 take it to the Editing Supervisor.

              2. Edit out all notes, land contracts or mortgages held or owned
                 by any business that the PEU owns or has an interest in.  


E9            If E9 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
              GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


E11.1         If E11 is YES:  Check the amount the PEU still owes at E11.1 and
              the amount it is still owed at E4 or E7.  If the amount at E11.1
              is considerably larger than the amount at E4 or E7, and there are
              marginal notes, write them on the Problem Sheet.

E15           Edit the # PROPERTIES entered in the box at E15 to be consistent
              with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 of the grid and E36-
              E37.6, as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


E15-E37.6     THE OTHER PROPERTY OWNED GRID

              1. Do NOT edit out "any property owned by a business that [PEU]
                 has an interest in" as instructed by the question at E14,
                 unless it is perfectly clear that the property is included or
                 is the same as the business listed in Section F.  If you
                 suspect that it is, but it is not perfectly clear, see the
                 Editing Supervisor.  These will be flagged with a special code
                 (see PROPERTY LINK CODE below).

              2. Do edit out properties owned by limited partnerships where R
                 is a limited partner if you find them in this section (UNLESS
                 R or the PEU member owning them are GENERAL PARTNERS).  Edit
                 them out of here (E16-E34.1) AND edit them into the F20-F24.6
                 section on passive businesses.  See the Editing Supervisor for
                 such cases and write them up on the Problem Sheet.

              3. Burial Plots, if listed here, should be moved to N52.1-N52.3. 
                 If there is any debt on them, move that to the Section I loan
                 grid.

              4. Mobile Homes should be included here, unless they are the
                 current residence of the PEU.  (See definition at G8, note 3.)

              5. Be particularly alert in this section for unusual or confusing
                 situations.  Take anything that seems suspicious to the
                 Editing Supervisor.

E16           Precode each property, using the PROPERTY LINK CODE, above the
              PROPERTY # heading for each column.  If you are unsure which code
              to use for a property, see the Editing Supervisor.

E17           1. If "Limited Partnerships" are noted here, see E15-E37.6, item
                 2 above.

              2. Box 1 "OWNED BY R" is meant to include ownership by R's
                 Spouse, either with R or alone.

E17.1-E33     Value and Debt on Property

              1. If marginal notes indicate that only the PEU's share is
                 recorded in E18-E29, compute and edit E18, E20, E23, E24 and
                 E26 to the totals for the property using the PEU's share at
                 E17.1.


              2. If the PEU owns TIMESHARE property, then leave E18-E29 as only
                 the PEU's share and edit E17 to "OWNED BY R unless the share
                 is owned together with other people outside the PEU.".  If the
                 entire value and debt on TIMESHARE property is given, compute
                 and edit it to the PEU's share only.

              3. Except for item 2 above, if E17.1 is NA or DK and it appears
                 that E18, E20, E23 and E24 are only the PEU's share, then NA
                 E18, E20, E23 and E24 and put this on the Problem Sheet.


E25           If E25 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
              GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22a.


E33           Edit the Type of Institution at E33 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


E34.1         Gross Income from Property
E36.7
E37.6         1. If there is any clear indication at E34.1, E36.7 or E37.6 that
                 the income amount given is "net" (see definition in Quick
                 Reference Guide) instead of "gross", NA the amount and write
                 the details on the Problem Sheet.

              2. If Income was received from the property other than RENTAL
                 income (such as parking fees, etc.) include them in the total. 
                 Total income from the property is wanted here, despite the
                 wording ("renting out") of the questions at E36.6 and E37.5.



                             SECTION F:  BUSINESSES

F1, F2      Check D1; if "R LIVES ON A RANCH AND FARM" is checked AND D3 is
            checked "YES", then box "R OR R"S FAMILY OPERATE FARM/RANCH BUSINESS
            ON THEIR PROPERTY" should be checked at F1 and there should be at
            least one business at F2 connected to the farm or ranch.  If not,
            bring the Interview to the Editing Supervisor.


F2, F4.1,         Edit the number entered in "# BUSINESSES" at F4.1 to be
F5                consistent with the number entered in the control
                  box at F5.  If R reports a business that is 
                  double-counted at N35 as publicly-traded stock,
                  remove the business from Section F.


F5          Edit the # OF BUSINESSES entered in the box at F5 to be consistent
            with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 and F19.1-F19.3 of the
            grid.


F6          If more than one box is checked or marginal notes are inconsistent
            with the box checked at F6, edit the boxes to one choice to indicate
            how the PEU originally acquired the business.  

            If necessary, edit the date at F8 to agree with the editing of F6.


F9.4        If R reports that a business is a "limited partnership" at F9.4, it
            should be moved to F20-F24.6 (PASSIVE BUSINESSES), but only if it is
            clearly stated that they (the PEU) are "limited partners" and not
            general partners.

            If the limited partnership is moved to F20-F24.6, all the details of
            the business should be written on the Problem Sheet and, if it is
            the only business, F4 should be edited to "NO".


F10, F10.1     CHECK FOR CURRENT COLLATERALIZED LOAN

            1. If F10 has been marked YES, but the answer to F10.1 indicates
               that R does not currently have a personal loan (i.e., F10.1 is
               "nothing"), edit F10 to NO.


F14, F15       Edit to include only PEU's share.

F16, F17       If the net income reported in F17 exceeds the gross receipts
               reported in F16, leave the inconsistency unless there are
               explanatory notes which support reversing the figures at F16 &
               F17.  If any explanatory information is available, write it on
               the Problem Sheet.


F20.1,      Check the number of other (non-actively managed) businesses
F21.1-21.6  reported at F20.1.  It should be equal to or greater than the
            number of types of businesses ("YES" boxes) checked for F21.1 -
            F21.6.  See the Editing Supervisor if it is not.



                               SECTION G: VEHICLES

G2          Edit the # LEASED VEHICLES entered in the box at G2 to be consistent
            with the number recorded in Columns #1, #2 and G6.1 as per GENERAL
            INSTRUCTION 24.


G3-G6.1 THE LEASED VEHICLE GRID

            1. Move any vehicles which are leased by a business but used by the
               PEU for personal purposes to G24.  These would include those
               leased by a business that the PEU has an interest in.  If the
               vehicle is leased by a business but not used by PEU for personal
               purposes, then edit them out.

            2. Edit out all leased motorhomes, travel trailers, motorcycles,
               snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles as well as tractors and mowers
               from G3-G6.1


G7.1        Edit the # OWNED VEHICLES entered in the box at G7.1 to be
            consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 and G23.1-
            G23.4, as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


G8-G23.4    THE OWNED VEHICLE GRID

            1. Move any vehicles owned by a business (including any the PEU has
               an interest in) but used by the PEU for personal
               purposes to G24.  If there are already vehicles at G24,
               and you are not sure whether the ones you are moving
               are already included there, leave them out and record
               all details on the Problem Sheet.  Those owned by a
               business but not used for personal purposes should be 
               edited out.

            2. Edit out any vehicles:

               a. not in running order

               b. not licensed now nor planned for licensing in 1993

               c. not yet purchased, or ordered but not yet received

               d. not owned by the PEU.

            3. Check for double-counting of debt in Section I.  If you find any,
               edit it out of Section I and leave it here.  If it is a part of
               a larger debt in Section I, leave it in Section I and remove the
               debt from Section G.

G8          Type of Vehicle

            1. Move all motorhomes, travel trailers, motorcycles, snowmobiles,
               and all-terrain vehicles to G25.1-G39.4 and write the description
               of the vehicle on a Problem Sheet.

            2. Edit tractors/mowers out.  If they are for personal use and have
               debt, move debt to Section I.

            3. Edit mobile homes to Section D and the mortgage grid if it is the
               current residence of the PEU or to the Section E Other Property
               Grid if it is not.
        

                                  DEFINITION    

G16         If G16 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


G22         Edit the type of institution at G22 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


G23.1-G23.4 If there is more information about cars and the debt volunteered at
            G23.1-G23.4 than can be captured in the Q's, write it on the Problem
            Sheet.


G24         Do not include vehicles leased by a business which the PEU uses
            regularly for personal purposes; write these on the Problem Sheet if
            found.


G25.1       Edit the # (Other) VEHICLES box at G25.1 to be consistent with the
            number recorded in Columns #1, #2 and G39.1-G39.4 in the OTHER
            VEHICLE GRID as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.

G26-G39.4   THE OTHER VEHICLE GRID

            Edit as per the Car Grid, G8-G23.4, items 2a-d & 3 and G8, items 2
            & 3.

G32         If G32 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


G38         Edit the type of institution at G38 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


G39.1-G39.4 If there is more information on the vehicles in G39.1-G39.4
            volunteered than can be captured in the Q's, write it on the Problem
            Sheet.


                           SECTION H: EDUCATION LOANS

H2      Edit the # OF LOANS entered in the box at H2 to be consistent with the
        number recorded in Columns #1-#6 (including LOANS #4-#6 on the EXTRA
        LOANS PAGES), as well as the number of loans from the grid that were
        moved to N53.1, as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.

H3      If the loan was taken out in several parts over time, we want the date
        that the earliest part was taken out.

H4      If the loan was taken out in several parts over time, we want the total
        of all the borrowing.

H8      R may have started paying on a loan more than once and then had payments
        deferred because she returned to school.  In such cases, take the most
        recent date that payments began.  In cases where the R has stopped
        paying at some point for reasons other than an official deferral, we
        want the date that payments were last official scheduled to begin.

H10      If H10 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per GENERAL
         INSTRUCTION 22.

H11      For regular installment loans where payments are not currently being
         made, edit H11 to '9995.  No payment being made.'  If they are behind
         or not paying the full payment amount, edit H11 to the amount they
         should pay and put the other information on a Problem Sheet.

H11.1   For loans and debts on which payments are not being made, edit the
        "typical payment" to 
        $"0" PER _____.

H15      Edit the type of institution at H15 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.
                                SECTION I:  LOANS

I1.1-1.4    1. In general, the number of loans recorded in I1.1-1.4 should sum
               to the number recorded in the box at I3, except when 2 or more
               smaller loans have been combined into one column to fit into the
               grid and are counted as only one loan there.  In that case, I1.1-
               1.4 will sum to the actual number of loans and the box at I3 will
               reflect the number after being combined.  If you edit loans into
               or out of the grid you must change the numbers recorded in I1.1-
               1.4, as well as the I3 control box.

        2.  If it should be necessary to distinguish between the categories of
            I1.1-1.4 assume 1.1 and 1.2 have high priority and 1.4 has low
            priority.


I3      Edit the # OF LOANS entered in the box at I3 to be consistent with the
        number recorded in Columns #1-#6 (including LOANS #4-#6 on the EXTRA
        LOAN PAGES), as well as the number of loans from the grid that were
        moved to N53.1, as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.  


I4-I15  THE (OTHER) LOAN GRID

            1.    EXCLUDE:

                  a. Business or farm debt that the PEU is not personally
                     liable for.  If it is unclear whether the business/farm or
                     the PEU is liable, check F10-F10b.  If it is still
                     unclear, leave it in and write it on the Problem Sheet.

                     2)       the bill is more than 3 months past due; or

                     3)       it amounts to $200 or more.

                     is double-counted at D55-D65.2, then it should be left
                     there only).

                  e. Defaulted co-signed notes: loans which a PEU member had
                     co-signed for someone else and for which the PEU member

                     in the interview and not excluded by any instructions
                     here.


I4          Code the purpose of the loan at I4 using the LOAN PURPOSE CODE. 
            Code the first two mentions if more than one is given.  If the
            purpose of a loan is investment in a business reported in Section F
            and the loans shows up at F10-F10.1, edit F10.2 to "YES" and note
            the appropriate loan in Section I at F10.3. 


I5          1.    For REGULAR INSTALLMENT loans (I7=1), if marginal notes
                  indicate that the date that the loan was taken out is
                  different than when the payments started, edit I5 to the date
                  the payments started.  If it is known that the date is
                  different, but it is not known the date they started, write it
                  on the Problem Sheet.

            2.    If payments haven't started yet, but date is known when they
                  will start, edit I5 to that date.

I7          1.    I7 should be edited to "REGULAR PAYMENTS" in all cases in
                  which current regular monthly payments have been agreed upon,
                  including overdue bills which the PEU has made "arrangements"
                  for.

            2.    I7 should be edited to "OTHER KIND" for:

                  a. loans not yet due or not yet being paid on;

                  b. past due bills on which no "arrangements" have been made;

                  c. loans for which the regular payments agreed on are not
                     monthly (i.e., "twice a month," "quarterly").  
                     NOTE:  In these cases, payments, and the frequency of
                     them, should be edited to I10.  You will have to NA I11 &
                     I12 UNLESS R volunteered them.

I8          If I8 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per GENERAL
            INSTRUCTION 22.

I9          For regular installment loans where payments are not currently being
            made, edit I9 to '9995.  No payment being made.'  If they are behind
            or not paying the full payment amount, edit I9 to the amount they
            should pay and put other information on a Problem Sheet.

I10         For loans and debts on which payments are not yet being made, edit
            the "typical payment" to $"0" PER ___.

I13         If the current interest rate for medical bills owed to doctors,
            dentists and medical facilities is NA or DK, leave it NA/DK.


I14         1.    Edit the type of institution at I14 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION
                  21.

            2.    For medical debts owed to doctors, hospitals or dentists,
                  precode "22".


I18         Edit the number of miles written in the blank to check boxes "LESS
            THAN A MILE" or "OVER 50 MILES" whenever appropriate.

                               SECTION N: FINANCIAL ASSETS

N1-N43.1                                                    GENERAL SECTION N
                                                            INSTRUCTIONS

            1.    Watch for accounts and assets that belong wholly or partly to
                  a business or to persons not in the PEU.

                  a.    If they belong wholly to the business or person outside
                        the HU, edit them out unless the business is a "sole
                        proprietorship", in which case see the Editing
                        Supervisor.  

                  b.    If they belong to an INDEPENDENT ADULT, check to make
                        sure they are included at Y37-Y38.3, and edit them out
                        here.

                  c.    If they are owned jointly with the PEU, and it is not
                        clear how to split them, leave them in, but NA the
                        amount.  Write these on the Problem Sheet.

            2.    Watch for margin notes or specific $ amounts reoccurring in
                  different places which would indicate the double-counting of
                  assets within Section N.

                  Amounts double-counted in two different places in Section N
                  should be left in the most specific type of account, unless
                  otherwise instructed (e.g., if listed in a savings account and
                  as an IRA--edit it out of the savings account and leave it in
                  the IRA).  

            3.    Assets from pension and profit sharing plans may be held in a
                  variety of ways and could be double counted in both Section N
                  and Section R.  Check assets and accounts in this section
                  against pension accounts for current jobs at R21, R32, R69 and
                  R80 and against pension accounts from past jobs at R99.3 and
                  R99.4.  If double counting is found, edit it out of Section N
                  and leave it in Section R, except for IRA's which may be left
                  in the R99.2 - R99.7 future pension grid and the N11-N14 IRA
                  grid if R99.7 is marked "YES, IRA/KEOGH".

                  If assets are found in this Section N which are clearly
                  labelled as being part of R's or S's current or future pension
                  or profit-sharing plans and which are not double-counted in
                  Section R see the Editing Supervisor.  For SEP-IRAs, see Note
                  2 at N12.

            4.    Check for instances where a R has not known total figures
                  because they did not know a component -- possibly because an
                  account belongs to another FU member (for example, R may not
                  know the amount of a daughter's U.S. Government bonds, but
                  does know the amount of his/her own bonds).  In these cases,
                  NA the amount and write the known, given amount on the Problem
                  Sheet, as well as noting there that there is also an unknown
                  amount.

            5.    Edit out any accounts that were not set-up at the time of the
                  first contact for the Interview. 

            6.    Be sure that accounts which are jointly held by two people in
                  the PEU are only counted once.

            7.    If margin notes anywhere in Section N, except at N41-N46,
                  indicate that the assets listed are part of a CMA or FMA, take
                  it to the Editing Supervisor.


N3          Edit the # of Checking ACCOUNTS entered in the box at N3 to be
            consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#6 of the Checking
            Account Grid and N8 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


            THE CHECKING ACCOUNT GRID

N4          Edit the type of institution at N4 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


N6          Check all accounts checked "YES" at N6 against the money market grid
            at N17-N20 for double-counting.  If any of them are clearly double-
            counted, edit them out of the checking account grid and leave them
            in the money market grid.  NOTE:  If that would edit all of the PEU
            checking accounts out, leave the first one listed in, and edit its
            counterpart out of the money market grid.  

            NEVER edit the main checking account (account #1) out of
            the checking account grid.  See the Editing Supervisor  
            in such cases.


N8          If more detail is given concerning the remaining checking accounts
            than is asked for at N8, enter it on the Problem Sheet.

N10-N14     THE IRA, KEOGH ACCOUNT GRID

            1.    Watch particularly for double-counting here with pension plans
                  as per instruction 3 at the beginning of this section.

            2.    However, if a SEP-IRA (Simplified Employee Pension) is listed
                  here and is not double-counted in Section R, leave it in this
                  grid and precode a "2" under the "IRA" box at N12.


N11, N13    Edit the type of institution at N13 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21
            --"CHECK ALL THAT APPLY".


N14.1       Be sure the correct skips are marked at the bottom of each column. 
            (This grid is not filled in sequentially, but in order of who has an
            IRA/KEOGH account.)


            THE MONEY MARKET GRID

N16.1       Edit the # OF MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS entered in the box at N16.1 to
            agree with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 and N21.1 as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


N19         Edit the type of institution at N19 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


N21.1       If more detail is given concerning the remaining money market
            accounts than is asked for at N21.1, enter it on the Problem Sheet.


N22-N22.5   CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT

            1.    Be particularly alert to double-counting with IRA's at N11-
                  N14; edit them out of here if such double-counting is found.

            2.    Watch for double-counting also with Section R.  See GENERAL
                  SECTION N INSTRUCTIONS item 3 if you find any.


N22.1,            Edit the type of institution at N22.3 as per GENERAL
INSTRUCTION 21--"CHECK ALL
N22.3       THAT APPLY".


N23.1       Edit the # of Savings ACCOUNTS entered in the box at N23.1 to agree
            with the number of savings accounts recorded in Columns #1-#5 and
            N26.1 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 24.


N24-N26     THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRID

            1.    This grid is intended to pick up any other savings-type
                  accounts that have not been included in earlier grids.  

                  Watch for double-counting with checking account, IRA, CD and
                  Money Market grids; edit them out of here if found.  Move any
                  such assets to their proper grids if they are found clearly
                  marked here and not there.

            2.    Include here passbook, statement savings and credit union
                  share accounts, Christmas Clubs and all other savings
                  accounts, as well as accounts at foreign banks, unions, AARP
                  or other organizations, building and loan associations, and
                  colleges.  


N24         Edit the type of institution at N24 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


N26.1       If more detail is given concerning the remaining savings accounts
            than is asked for at N26.1, enter it on the Problem Sheet.


N28.1-N28.5 MUTUAL FUND GRID


            1.    Watch for double-counting of mutual funds with
                  pension funds in Sections R as per instruction 3 for
                  this section. 

            2.    Check for double-counting of:

                  a.    STOCK FUNDS at N28.1 and stock at N37 & N39, and

                  b.    BOND FUNDS at N28.2-N28.4 and bonds at N31.1, N32.1 or 
                        N33.1-N33.4.

                  out of the later section(s).

N32         BONDS AND BILLS

            Check that the number entered in the # BONDS OR BILLS blank is not
            less than the number of boxes checked "YES" at N33.1-N33.4.


N33.1-            Watch for double-counting of bonds with pension funds in

            1.    Watch for double-counting with pension or profit sharing funds
                  in Section R as per instruction 3 for this section.

            2.    Check for consistency between N37 & N39.1 if N39 is "YES".

                  a.    N39.1 must be equal to or less than N37.

                  b.    If N36 is "1", then N37 and N39.1 must be the same.

                  If either of the above is not true, see the Editing
                  Supervisor.

            3.    If there is any indication that the amount of N39.1 includes
                  stock in a business in Section F, see the Editing Supervisor.

            4.    Stock which is clearly not publicly traded and can be
                  separated from publicly traded stock should be moved to N52--
                  "other assets."  You should check Section F for double-
                  counting.


N40.1-N40.6 BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS

            If any significant extra detail (not codeable in N40.1-N40.6)
            regarding a brokerage account (such as the amount due on a margin
            account) is volunteered by R, add it to the Problem Sheet.


N41-N46     TRUSTS, ANNUITIES, AND MANAGED INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS

            1.    Check the margin notes in this sequence for any indication
                  that the assets recorded are double-counted in any of the
                  accounts reported earlier in this section.  If you find any,
                  see the Editing Supervisor.

            2.    If R mentions a "limited time annuity" and any details are
                  given in margin notes, add them to the Problem Sheet.


N47-N50     LIFE INSURANCE

            Exclude life insurance policies whose beneficiary is a business in
            Section F.


N48, N48.1  If "burial insurance" is mentioned at N48-N48.1, leave it.

N49.5       If the loan is reported earlier in the interview, edit the loan out
            of the earlier location and change N49.5 to 3.  If there is any
            ambiguity about the loan, see the Editing Supervisor.  

N51, N51.1  MONEY OWED TO THE PEU

            1.    Exclude:

                  a.    money owed to a PEU business;

                  b.    money owed to one PEU member by another PEU member

                  c.    money that R doesn't expect to be repaid, including
                        "probably won't."

            2.    If at N51 a note says the PEU is owed money by a business in
                  Section F, check F11-F11.1 to determine if it is included
                  there:

                  a.    if it is, edit it out of here (N51-N51.1).

                  b.    if it is not, move it to F11-F11.1.

                  c.    if you are unsure about the double-counting, take it to
                        the Editing Supervisor.

            3.    Money owed to the PEU by a business that has been sold should
                  be left here.




N52-N52.3   OTHER ASSETS

            1.    Move items that should be included in other sections to their
                  appropriate place.  If you have doubts concerning whether or
                  not to move something, see the Editing Supervisor.

                  a.    Move any vehicles found here (including antique and
                        valuable vehicles) to Section G.  Assume that there is
                        no debt on them unless there is contrary evidence.  

            2.    Some items which should be included here:

                  a.    antique and valuable items and collections

                  b.    silver, gold, jewelry

                  c.    cash

            3.    Do not edit items out just because the value seems small.

            4.    Move any future inheritances or estates mentioned here to X9
                  and delete them from here.


N53-N53.1   OTHER DEBTS

            1.    Edit out any debts which have been listed in other sections.

            2.    Move all bills of $200 or more whose purpose is clear to the
                  Section I loan grid if they meet the qualifications there.

            3.    Debts for business purposes should be moved to the Section I
                  loan grid if is clear that the PEU is personally liable.  (A
                  bankruptcy debt for an unincorporated business or debt on a
                  business no longer in operation would be examples.)



                       SECTION R: EMPLOYMENT OF RESPONDENT


R1          1.    Check that a two-digit occupation status code has been
                  precoded in green next to the status boxes.  If not, see an
                  occupation coder or the Editing Supervisor.

            2.    If R mentions here that his/her work is 'volunteer' work, see
                  the Editing Supervisor.



R1.4        RETIREMENT DATE

            1.    If both "RETIRED" and "DISABLED" are checked at R1 AND two
                  dates are given at R1.4, edit R1.4 to the date which is
                  consistent with the green two-digit occupation status code.  

            2.    If R has retired twice (2 dates are given), keep only the most
                  recent date.  Put the other date on a Problem Sheet.  This
                  will occur often with career military persons who go on to
                  second careers.


R2          CHECK SELF-EMPLOYMENT

            1.    If the "RUN MY OWN BUSINESS" box at R2 is checked, edit R2 to
                  "SELF-EMPLOYED."  

            2.    Make sure no self-employed persons followed the "SOMEONE ELSE"
                  sequence.  If they did, move the information in R3-R12 to the
                  appropriate matching questions at R14-R13.  R8 should be moved
                  to R14.8 and R15 to R14.13.  

            3.    If you are unsure whether you should consider someone "SELF-
                  EMPLOYED," see the Editing Supervisor.

            NOTE:  A person does not need to have a business listed in Section
            F to be self-employed.  Not all self-employed people own businesses.


R3, R4            MAIN OCCUPATION:  R WORKS FOR SOMEONE ELSE

            1.    Check that there is a three-digit green precode to the left of
                  R3 and R5.  If either is missing, see an occupation coder or
                  the Editing Supervisor.

            2.    If R's response to R3 and R4 seems to include two different
                  jobs, one of them should have been moved to R's second job at
                  R40-R44.  Check in these cases to see that a second job is at
                  R40-R44; if it is not, see an occupation coder or the Editing
                  Supervisor.


R7          EDIT WEEKS WORKED

            1. Edit any non-week response to # of WEEKS normally worked,
               assuming 4.3 weeks to a month.

            2. For teachers and other school personnel:

               a.       Do not edit teachers or "school personnel" to 52 weeks
                        worked, if the answer is less.

               b.       Check that the salary reported at R8 is consistent with
                        the # WEEKS R reported at R7.  If not, edit the salary
                        to an annual basis.

            3. Note that Q reads "...in a normal year."  If R answers that
               he/she hasn't worked for a full year yet and it is reasonably
               clear that the job is not seasonal, edit R7 to 52 weeks.


R8          1. If the salary/wages are given "after taxes", NA R8 and record the
               details on the Problem Sheet.

            2. If R says he/she isn't paid:

               a.       If R does volunteer work (such as with United Way,
                        church work, etc.), take it to the Editing Supervisor
                        and put it on a Problem Sheet if R works more than 35
                        hrs/week.

               b.       For those whose income is "paid in kind", include the
                        value of the "in kind payment" in or as their wage
                        (e.g., someone who manages an apartment building and
                        receives their own rent free as their wage earns the
                        value of their rent).

               c.       Whenever the marginal notes or amounts for the above are
                        unclear, write the information on the Problem Sheet.

R14, R14.1  MAIN OCCUPATION:  SELF-EMPLOYED

            1. Check that the three digit occupation and industry codes are
               precoded to the left of R14 and R14.1.  See an occupation coder
               or the Editing Supervisor if they are missing.

            2. If R's response to R14 and R14.1 seems to be two different jobs,
               edit as per instruction 2 for R3, R4.


R14.6       Edit R14.6 as per instructions for R7.

R14.7-         Edit R14.7-R14.10 using all information available.  If it is not
               clear which box should be
R14.10         checked, see the Editing Supervisor.

R14.8 or    For those who work in a family business or farm without wages, edit
            R14.10 to '0' per 'WK'.
R14.10         
      
R17.1       IF RECEIVING BENEFITS

            1. If R17.1 is "YES", check R97.3 to verify that "CURR JOB PENS" is
               checked, for at least one column, for this R.  (NOTE: RECIPIENT
               is found checked at the top of the column).

            2. If R17.1 is "NO", check that the # PLANS entered in R17 agrees
               exactly with the # OF PLANS entered in the box at R18.  If they
               do not, see the Editing Supervisor.

R17.2       If R17.2 is "YES", check that the # PLANS--NOT YET RECEIVING
            BENEFITS at R17.3 agrees exactly with the # OF PLANS entered in the
            box at R18.  If they do not, see the Editing Supervisor.

R18         Edit the # OF Pension or Retirement PLANS entered in the box at R18
            to be consistent with the number of plans recorded in Columns #1-#3
            and R39-R39.1 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.

R21         Double-check that amounts at R21 are not double-counted in Section
            N.  If they are, edit them out of Section N.

R23         If "Employer Contributions" are mentioned, write this on the Problem
            Sheet.

R26         If more than one box is checked, priority code the lowest number and
            the benefit amount at R26.1, consistently if possible.

R30.1, R31.1   Check these questions for complex responses (e.g., "match 2% and
               then 1/2 of next 4%).  If you find one, take it to the Editing
               Supervisor and put it on the Problem Sheet.

R32         Double-check N14,  N20, N25 and N28.1-N28.5 to make sure the amounts
            mentioned here at R32 are not double-counted there.  If they are,
            edit them out of the location in Section N and leave them here in
            Section R.

R36         Check for write-in responses at R36.

            1. If "I wouldn't get anything until I retire," check the "OTHER"
               box and NA the "PERCENT" at R36.1.

            2. If "It would roll over into another account," check the "NONE"
               box, unless marginal notes indicate this is not true.
 
R39.1       If anything is entered in R39.1, enter it on the Problem Sheet.

R41-R43     If it is necessary to edit in R's second job at R40-R40.2 and it is
            clear that R has already included all of his HOURS, WEEKS and INCOME
            for this job in R6-R8 with his main job and it is unclear how to
            separate them you should leave them in R6-R8 and code R41-R43 "0",
            unless the job being edited in is Military Reserve or National
            Guard.  In that case, see R41, R42 below.

R41, R42    If R's second job is the Military Reserve or the National Guard and
            R41 (# HOURS) and R42 (# WEEKS) are NA or DK, assume 20 hours per
            week for 13 weeks.

R43         EDIT SECOND JOB EARNINGS

            1. Edit any dollars per hour responses at R43 to dollars per week
               using the hours given at R41.

            2. Edit other responses to R43 as per R8.

            3. In addition, edit the following cases to $"0" per week if their
               earnings are NA:

               a.       Wives who work on the family farm or in the family
                        business but who haven't reported it as their main job
                        and report no second job.  (For wives who do report it
                        as a job, but without pay--see note 4b at R8.)

               b.       Those cases specified for R41-R43 above.


            WORK HISTORY--FULL TIME NOW

R45.4 &     Check that three-digit OCC and IND codes have been precoded to the
            left of R45.4 and R45.5.
R45.5

R45.6 &     1. Edit "YEARS AGO" to "19___" by subtracting the number of "years
               ago" given from
R45.7          the year of the Interview.


            2. If there was a break in service between the 'START' date at R45.6
               and the 'STOP' date at R45.7, write the break details on the
               Problem Sheet.

R45.11,        1.       If R answers with a range, edit it to the midpoint and
                        record the range on a Problem
R45.13            Sheet.                                                      

            2. The intention of the question is to find when R plans to stop
               working full-time for good.  If R answers that he/she plans to
               stop, but then start again at a later date, NA the response or
               edit it to the data consistent with the intent of the question,
               if that is known.


            WORK HISTORY--PART TIME NOW

R46.4       Edit "# YEARS AGO" to "19___" as per instructions for R45.6 and
            45.7.

R47.15 -    1. Edit "AT AGE" to "IN ___ YEARS" as per instructions for R45.13
R47.14            and R45.16.
    
R47.15 -    2. If R answers with a range, edit it to the midpoint and record the
               range on a Problem
R47.19            Sheet.

R49         CHECK FOR CONSISTENCY BETWEEN R49 AND HHL BOX

            1. If R49 is checked "R. IS MARRIED/LIVING WITH PARTNER" then:

               a.       R should have "M" or "P" circled in column D of the 

               b.       The SPOUSE SECTION should be completed.

               c.       If the SPOUSE SECTION is blank, see the Editing
                        Supervisor.

            2. If R49 is checked "ALL OTHERS" then R will not have "M" or "P"
               circled box nor should a SPOUSE SECTION be included with the
               Interview.

               a.       If a SPOUSE SECTION is complete in this case, see the
                        Editing Supervisor and then print "DO NOT CODE" in large
                        letters across the cover of the booklet.


R49-R95.2   Edit the SPOUSE SECTION as per R1-R47.19 above.  All Q #s in the
SPOUSE SECTION          correspond to the Qs in the R Section.


R96.4-R96.6 SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS

            1. Edit out all non-Social Security payments; if in doubt, see the
               Editing Supervisor.

            2. Edit out SSI payments (Supplemental Security Income) and if it
               was received in 1992, check T1.11 & T2.11 to make sure it is
               included there.

            3. Edit out all Social Security benefits for anyone except the
               Respondent and the Spouse/Partner (however, make sure they are
               included at T2.12 before you do).

            4. "SURVIVORS BENEFITS":

               a.       if they are for a widowed person 62 or over, leave them
                        here and edit R96.4. "RETIRE";

               b.       Otherwise, leave as it is.

            5. If Social Security benefits for minor HH children are being
               received (e.g., disability), include the amount with the payment
               of the adult who is receiving them.


R96.4       If both "RETIRE" and "DISAB" are checked, and there are no notes to
            explain why:

            1. If the person is 62 years old or older, edit to "RETIRE".

            2. If under 62, edit to "DISAB".


R96.5       Edit "SINCE" to "# YEARS" for both columns as per instructions at
            R10.


R96.6       1. Check that R96.6 (S.S. benefits being received) is not double-
               counted at R97.5 (other benefits being received) or at R97.7
               (benefits expected to be received in the future).  If any are,
               edit them out of the inappropriate place.  

               NOTE:  Benefits for which no payment has yet been received are
               expected benefits.

            2. If a single amount is given for both R & S, and is based all or
               mostly on the earnings of one individual, split the amount and
               allocate 2/3 to the primary wage earner and 1/3 to the other
               person.


R97.1       1. Edit the # PENSIONS/DISABILITY PAYMENTS entered in the box at
               R97.1 to agree with the number recorded in columns 1-6 (FIRST
               BENEFIT-SIXTH BENEFIT) as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


R97.3       If "CURR JOB PENS" is checked in any column, after ascertaining the
            RECIPIENT from the top of the column:

            1. Check the Recipient's job status at R1-R6 or R49-R55 to verify
               they have a current job.

            2. Check R17.1 or R63 to verify that they reported that they are
               receiving benefits from it.

            3. If information is inconsistent, see the Editing Supervisor.

            4. Delete SSI if reported here.  If it was received in 1992, check
               T1.11 and T2.11 to make sure it is included there.


R98.1       Edit the # CASH SETTLEMENTS entered in the box at R98.1 to be
            consistent with the number recorded in Rows #1-#5.


R98.2-R98.4 CASH SETTLEMENT GRID

            Cash settlements may match assets reported elsewhere, especially in
            Section N.  Leave any double reporting, since the question is
            concerned only with the source of the asset.



                               SECTION T:  INCOME

T1-T7.8        GENERAL SECTION INSTRUCTIONS

            1. Section T should contain the 1991 income of all of the current
               PEU, i.e., the PEU members who are included in the HHL box.  This
               may be a problem for recently married, divorced, or separated Rs. 
               Edit out any income clearly not belonging to the current PEU and
               bring to the Editing Supervisor any unclear cases or cases where
               1991 income of a current PEU member has been left out.

               NOTE:  If a deceased spouse was in the Household during 1991,
               include his/her income.

            2. If income of a financially independent household member is
               reported in Section T, it should be moved to Section Y, if it is
               not already included there.

            3. Do not force consistency between this section (T) and any of the
               other sections of the Interview unless specifically directed to
               by these instructions or unless important 1991 income information
               will not be reported anywhere else in the Interview.  Thus, for
               example, if R reports an income amount at E34.1 (where income
               from property is asked for), but does not report any income at
               T1.7, you should not change T1.7.  However, if R mentions an
               income component in a margin note somewhere in the Interview
               which will not be coded anywhere else, edit it in to T2.1-T2.12
               if it is not there.  In all cases, check with the Editing
               Supervisor before editing any income into the T section.


T1.1-T1.12 &      Check consistency between T1 and T2 for income
T2.1-T2.12        components 1-12. 

            1. If T1 is checked "NO" or left blank and an amount is entered in
               T2, edit T1 to "YES", unless it is clear that the Interviewer
               checked the wrong box or entered the amount in the wrong place.

            2. If T1 is checked "YES" but T2 is left blank, NA T2, unless there
               is some indication what the amount should be (e.g., "I already
               told you that").

            3. Otherwise, the boxes at T1 should not be changed, unless
               specifically directed to by these instructions or the Editing
               Supervisor, even if T1 is checked "NO" but you know from evidence
               in other sections of the Interview that the PEU had income from
               this source (e.g., an amount is reported at E34.1 but T1.7 is
               checked "NO").

            4. Losses are only expected to appear at T2.2, T2.6, T2.7, and
               T2.11.  Mark all losses clearly with parentheses.  If losses are
               reported at any other location, see the Editing Supervisor.


T2.1-T2.12  1991 INCOME COMPONENTS

            Edit all non-yearly amounts in T2.1-T2.12 to annual amounts for
            1991.  Use all information given in margin notes and, in the absence
            of other evidence, assume 12 months, 52 weeks and 26 bi-weekly
            periods in a year and 4.3 weeks in a month.

T2.3        This should include income from tax-free bonds/mutual funds/money
            market funds.  If these are reported elsewhere in T2.1-T2.12, move
            them here to T2.3, but only if clearly specified as 'tax-free'.

T2.10       If R's housing is partially or fully subsidized by a governmental
            unit (learned from the TN or marginal notes), check T1.10 "YES" and
            write in 'SUBSIDIZED RENT'.  Enter the amount at T2.10 if it is
            known, NA if it is not.  If the rent subsidy is included in the
            amount given at T2.10, move it to T1.12 if the amount is known.  If
            it can't be separated, code T2.10 as given and record on the Problem
            Sheet that Subsidized Rent is included.

T2.12       1. Move items listed at T2.12 that belong in T2.1-T2.11 to their
               proper location.  Move the types below to the locations noted:

               TYPE OF INCOME                                                 
                  MOVE TO:

               Net gain from sale of business............................T2.6
               Child care income.........................................T2.1
               U.S. Army VAQ (HOUSING ALLOWANCE) pay.....................T2.1
               Jury duty pay.............................................T2.1
               Corporate Board of Directors fees.........................T2.1 
               Deferred compensation (from a job)........................T2.1

            2. Edit out:            Tax refunds
                                    Student Loans
                                    Employer contributions to Pension Plans

            3. Leave in T1.12:      Money from relatives       
                                    IRA withdrawals

T3          Do not edit T3 for consistency with its components.  In general, T3
            should not be edited at all (i.e., it should be kept as independent
            as possible from T2.1-T2.12) EXCEPT:

            1. If T3 is missing (i.e., left blank), edit NA into the blank.

            2. If R volunteers information in marginal notes at T3 which is a
               codeable response or which must be added or subtracted from the
               response given, you should edit it in.  E.g., "$25,000" (at T3)
               "and the commission I mentioned before" (volunteered). 
               Otherwise, you should leave any codeable response at T3 unedited.

               a.         If R volunteers "just add it up", then just add it up
                          (i.e., sum T2.1-T2.12).

            3. As indicated at T4-T4.6 below.


T4-T4.6     If, in the process of responding to T4-T4.6, R volunteers a codeable
            response for T3 (e.g., at T4.6 R states "more like $150,000" or T4.2
            R volunteers "$24,000"), you should move the response to T3 and edit
            out the DK/REF box checked there.  


T6          1. DO NOT edit out gifts or presents to others (including to
               relatives and friends).  Thus, you would not edit out "Christmas
               present to mother" and "We gave brother $2000 for his birthday".

            2. Edit charitable contributions to other than relatives and friends
               to X10.1.  Thus, "sent $40 per month to an orphan child in
               Mexico" should be moved to X10.1.

            3. Also, edit out loans which it is clear are expected to
               be repaid.  
               

T7          For R's recently divorced or separated, and not living with their
            spouse, check T7.1-7.4 to make sure they are edited as follows:

            1. T7.1 must be checked "ALL OTHERS".

            2. T7.4 should be only the AGI of the current PEU.  If it includes
               the income of the separated/divorced spouse, or may include it,
               leave T7.4 as is but write it on the Problem Sheet.

            3. If there is any indication that R and the divorced/separated
               spouse filed their 1991 taxes jointly (i.e., box is checked or
               marginal note says so), put this information on a Problem Sheet.



                  SECTION X: CHARITY AND INTER-FAMILY TRANSFERS

X1-X8       Assets mentioned in Section X may match amounts listed in Section N
            or other places in the I'w.  Leave the double counting, since this
            section is concerned with the source of the asset.  We want all of
            the assets reported as inherited in Sections D, E, and F to appear
            here as well. 


X2          Edit the # OF INHERITANCES, TRUSTS, OTHER TRANSFERS entered in the
            box at X2 to be consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3
            and X8 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


X5          If more than one date is given at X5, indicating more than one
            inheritance from the same source, leave the earliest and move the
            other(s) to the next columns, if they are available.  If there are
            no empty column(s) to edit them to, move them to the mop-up Q at X8.
      

X10         If R volunteered time (not money or property) and gave charitable
            contributions in that way, edit it out.



                      SECTION Y: RESPONDENT DEMOGRAPHICS

            GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ON DEMOGRAPHICS

Y7-Y23.2       Edit these questions to agree with other information in the
               Interview and in the HHL box.  See the Editing Supervisor if you
               are unsure.  


Y5          If R mentions "children" in the Interview but none are in the HHL
            box and "NONE" is checked at Y5, see the Editing Supervisor.


Y7          Check the CHECKPOINT at Y7 for accuracy and make sure the
            appropriate sequence has been followed.

Y8.5        For separated Rs:  This question should be consistent with the
            information reported in other sections.  If R reports, for example,
            assets are mostly 'OWNED BY R', edit all sections to reflect only
            the R's assets, debts, and income.  If they are 'OWNED JOINTLY',
            make the sections consistent with this response.  If you have reason
            to believe the data do not reflect what the R reported in Y8.5, take
            the interview to the Editing Supervisor.

Y16         Check the CHECKPOINT at Y16 to agree with the HHL box and to make
            sure the appropriate sequence was followed.

Y25         Check the CHECKPOINT at Y25 to agree with the HHL box and to make
            sure the appropriate sequence has been followed.

Y33         Check the CHECKPOINT at Y33 to agree with the HHL box and to make
            sure the appropriate sequence has been followed.


Y34.2       1. If Y34.2 is checked "YES", edit the amount reported at Y34.1 out
               of T2.1-T2.12 and T3.  Then edit this question (Y34.2) from "YES"
               to "3" to indicate that the information was double-counted but
               is now corrected.  

            2. If it is unclear where or whether the amount at Y34.3 is double-
               counted, see the Editing Supervisor and put the information on
               the Problem Sheet.  If the amount is not moved out of the income
               section, leave Y34.2 marked "YES".  Pg. 56, Y35.3: Copy question
               at Y34.2 with necessary changes 

Y36.2       If Y36.2 is checked "YES", check the vehicle grids at G8-G23.4 and
            G2.2-G39.1 and see if you can determine with assurance which of the
            vehicles there is the one whose value is specified at Y36.1.  If you
            can, edit that vehicle out of the G section and edit this Q as per
            Y34.2, item 1.

            If it is not clear which vehicle is specified, then do nothing and
            leave Y34.2 checked "YES".






Y37.2       If Y37.2 is checked "YES" edit the amount reported at Y37.1 out of:


                  ACCOUNT                                                     
                  LOCATION       PAGE #

                  N5 & N8        74, 75
                  N14            77
                  N20 & N22.1    78, 79
                  N22.2          79
                  N25 & N26.1    80, 81
                  N31.1          83

            and edit Y37.2 as per instruction for Y34.2, item 1.

            If it is clear that the amount at Y37.1 is only part of the amount
            in the account (i.e., it is a joint account with a PEU member), edit
            out only the amount specified.  If, however, the amount is the whole
            account, then edit the account out, remembering to adjust the # of
            accounts at that location.


Y38.2       If Y38.3 is checked "YES", edit the amount reported at Y38.2 (except
            for the amount which is reported at Y39.2, if yes at Y38.1 is
            checked) out of the following locations depending on which boxes are
            checked at Y38.1:

            Edit Y38.3 as per instructions for Y34.2 (unless 01 is circled at
            Y38.1 in which case you should leave Y38.1 "YES").


Y39         Check the CHECKPOINT at Y39 to agree with Y38.1 and to make sure the
            appropriate sequence has been followed.

Y39.1       If the house is owned only by people actually living there, this
            should be the percent no owned by the PEU.  If the house is owned in
            part by people who do not live there, this figure should be the
            percent of the part of the house owned by the PEU and the people
            with independent finances. 

Y39.2-Y39.3 Be sure that the dollar figures reported here are the total for all
            people living in the HU, not just the share belonging to the people
            with independent finances.  If the PEU owns any part of the house or
            is responsible for any of the mortgage, the share of the PEU should
            show up in Section D  


Y42-Y43           CHECK FOR ACCURACY OF THESE CHECKPOINTS

            If R is covered by a pension on a current job, 1 at Y42 should be
            circled;  if S is covered by a pension on a current job, 2 at Y43
            should be circled.  If either of these are not consistent, bring to
            the Editing Supervisor.



                            SECTION ZZ: OBSERVATION



ZZ2         CHECK TYPE OF STRUCTURE

            There should be just one box checked at ZZ2.  If more than one is
            checked, edit out all but one.  You can probably determine which is
            right by checking Section D.  If not, see Editing Supervisor.
