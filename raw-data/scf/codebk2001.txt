WARNING: This codebook contains over 60,000 lines of text, including
this introduction, variable descriptions, the source code for the
computer program used to collect the survey data, and other material.
Most users will probably NOT want to print the entire document.
Generally, we recommend working with the material in a text editor
using a non-proportional font for display.

This codebook serves as the principal guide to the variables
included on the final public version (February 20, 2003 version) of the
2001 SCF data set.  However, not every variable included in this
codebook is actually in the public use data set.  Among other things,
the data set does NOT include sample design variables, any geography,
or the 3-digit industry and occupation codes.  Although we have
attempted to mark the variables in the codebook that are not available
to the public, there may be errors and omissions.  The definitive list
of the variables included is given at the end of this file.  Please
consult that list to determine whether a given variable is available
to you.

The SCF is sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System in cooperation with the Statistics of Income Division of the
Internal Revenue Service.  Data for the 2001 SCF were collected by the
National Organization for Research at the University of Chicago (NORC).

For a general overview of the 2001 SCF, see Ana M. Aizcorbe, Arthur
B. Kennickell, and Kevin B. Moore "Recent Changes in U.S. Family
Finances: Results from the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal
Reserve Bulletin, January 2003, pp. 1-xxx.  Results you may obtain
from using this release of the 2001 SCF may differ from those
reported in this article for several reasons.  First, the analysis
weights used in that article were altered to provide robust estimates
of the detailed categories shown.  In brief, the data were examined for
extreme outliers, and where a given case was overly influential in
determining an outcome, the weight was trimmed and other weights were
inflated to maintain a constant population.  Second, as noted below,
the public version of the data has been systematically altered to
minimize the likelihood that unusual individual cases could be
identified.  Our analysis of the public data set suggests that these
changes should not alter the conclusions of reasonable analyses of the
data.  Finally, over time we correct errors that we find in the
data set.  In our past experience, the effects of such errors on the
estimates have been quite small.

This codebook is intended to provide only an overview of the most
critical technical elements of the survey.  For more details, see

Finances: Methodology and Directions for Future Research," May 2000,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The primary data files for the survey consist of the following pieces:
the main data set and a file of replicate weights corresponding to
X42001 (see below for a description of the replicate weights).  In 
addition, an aggregated version of the main data set containing summary
variables corresponding to those used in "Recent Changes in U.S. Family 
Finances: Results from the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances" 
(Ana M. Aizcorbe, Arthur B. Kennickell, and Kevin B. Moore, Federal 
Reserve Bulletin, Janary 2003, v. 89, pp. 1-32) is available in a
format compatible with most spreadsheet software.  To aid users in 
reconciling their calculations with those found in the January 2003 
Bulletin article, two sets of tables comparable to those in the
article are provided: the first set is based on the current internal 
version of the data, and the second version is based on the current 
public version of the data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTIONNAIRE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2001 SCF was collected using computer-assisted personal
interviewing (CAPI).  Thus, there is no questionnaire in the usual
sense.  This codebook serves as the most comprehensive guide to the
definitions of variables included in the survey.  Later in this
file, copies of the Surveycraft (SC) programs that were used to collect
the data are included.  The SC programs serve as the authoritative
reference for questions relating to question ordering and skip
sequences.  Because question ordering is important in understanding
the meaning of many questions, users of the data are encouraged to
consult the SC program.  After the SC program, a translation of most
SC variables into SCF variables is provided.  Although there
is usually a direct correspondence between the SC variables and the
final variables listed in this codebook, there are some places where
the connections are indirect: In some cases, the same question is
asked in two difference places, and in the final data set all instances
of answers to the question are mapped into a single location; in other
cases variables may be inferred from other information (for example,
if a respondent reported a wage on a current job and reported that
their employer contributed a certain percent of their wage to a
pension plan, then the dollar contribution to the plan would be filled
in).  Almost always, the data rearrangements can be identified from
the shadow variables associated with the variables (see section
"VARIABLE NAMES" below).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNIT OF ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the data in the survey are intended to represent the financial
characteristics of a subset of the household unit referred to as the
"primary economic unit" (PEU).  In brief, the PEU consists of an
economically dominant single individual or couple (married or living
as partners) in a household and all other individuals in the household
who are financially dependent on that individual or couple.  For
example, in the case of a household composed of a married couple who
own their home, a minor child, a dependent adult child, and a
financially independent parent of one of the members of the couple,
the PEU would be the couple and the two children.  Summary information
is collected at the end of the interview for all household members who
are not included in the PEU.  The only variables collected separately
for the respondent and the spouse or partner of the respondent are
those concerning employment, pension, and demographic characteristics.
Throughout the codebook, we refer to the "head" of the household.  The
use of this term is euphemistic and merely reflects the systematic way
in which the data set has been organized.  The head is taken to be the
single core individual in a PEU without a core couple.  In a PEU with
a central couple, the head is taken to be either the male in a
mixed-sex couple or the older individual in the case of a same-sex
couple.  No judgment about the internal organization of the households
is implied by this organization of the data.  When the original
respondent was someone other than the person determined to be the head
in this sense, all data (including response codes) for the two members
of the couple were systematically swapped. The variable X8000
indicates which cases have been subjected to such rearrangement.

NOTE: Because only limited information is collected on the
ownership of assets and liabilities within the PEU, it is not
possible, in general, to make direct separate estimates of the
financial characteristics of the individuals in the survey
households unless one is prepared to make a number of fairly complex
assumptions.  To understand this point more thoroughly, there is no
substitute for a careful reading of the actual survey questions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLE DESIGN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SCF is based on a dual-frame sample design.  One set of the survey
cases was selected from a standard multi-stage area-probability
design.  This part of the sample, which contributed 2,917 cases to the
final set of interviews, is intended to provide good coverage of
characteristics, such as home ownership, that are broadly distributed
in the population.  The other set of the survey cases was selected as
a list sample from statistical records (the Individual Tax File)
derived from tax data by the Statistics of Income Division of the
Internal Revenue Service (SOI).  These records were made available
under strict rules governing confidentiality, the rights of potential
respondents to refuse participation in the survey, and the types of
information that can be made available.  This second sample was
designed to disproportionately select families that were likely to be
relatively wealthy (see "Modeling Wealth with Multiple Observations of
Income: Redesign of the Sample for the 2001 Survey of Consumer
Finances," Arthur B. Kennickell, October 2001,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html for a more
extended discussion of the design of the list sample).  The list
sample contributed 1,532 cases to the final set of interviews.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For many purposes it is useful to know which responses were available
to the interviewer and which were actually known by the respondent.
Responses that are noted in the codeframes below by an asterisk are
ones that were available to the interviewer on the screen during the
interview.  In general, if a response is given in the codebook in
lower case letters, this indicates that it was permissible for the
interviewer to read it to the respondent.  Responses listed in all
upper case letters are ones that were not intended to be read to the
respondent.  Codes that result from the recoding of responses
originally reported as "other" are also given in lower case letters.
Other subsidiary question texts given in capital letters are intended
as interviewer instructions.

In some cases, codes were available conditional on responses to
earlier questions.  One such example that appears throughout the
interview is the reporting of institutions where the respondent has
accounts of some type.  If the respondent reported fewer than six
financial institution at X305, every time the interviewer came to a
question that asked about the institution where the respondent had an
account, the screen displayed the names of the already listed
institutions (referred to as "Institution 1" etc. in the codebook), a
code for "add an institution," and a code to enter to record an
unusual type of institution ("not a financial institution"). Once six
institutions had been recorded (either at X305 or by adding
institutions later in the interview), the screen displayed the names
of the six institutions, the "not a financial institution" field,  and
a set of codes for the type of institution (i.e., commercial bank,
savings and loan or savings bank, credit union, etc.).

For many questions there are multiple versions.  Most commonly, there
are variants that are appropriate for single individuals and ones
appropriate for families of two or more.  Some other variants are more
complicated.  For example, suppose that a respondent lives in a
building with multiple housing units (X702=1), the family owns the
entire building (X714=1), and they own the unit they live in
separately from the rest of the building.  The CAPI program stores the
information that there is such a property.  Later in the interview
when the respondent is asked about the number of investment real
estate and vacation properties, one variant of question X1701 reminds
the respondent to include the property mentioned earlier.  There are
many other such instances where the computer alters questions to
suit the previous answers given by the respondent, and this codebook
attempts to provide at least a summary form of all the possible
questions.  For example, at X1711 (correspondingly at X1811 and
X1911), the respondent is asked whether there are any outstanding
loans on a property.  If the respondent had previously reported at
X1703 (correspondingly at X1803 and X1903) that the property was a
time-share, then the variant for time-shares is asked; otherwise a
more generic question is asked.

The authoritative references for deterimining how the information was
presented to the respondent are the executable CAPI program, which is
available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/2001/scf2001home.html,
and the text of the CAPI program appended to this codebook.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLE NAMES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This codebook refers to the variables by the names they have in the
version of the survey data set formatted for use with SAS.  These names
consist of a number prefixed by an "X."  We have tried, insofar as it
was possible, to retain the variable numbering system used in earlier
SCFs.  Where the content of a variable has changed in a substantive
way, we have assigned a new variable number.  Since the 1998 SCF, 
the following variables were added: X6497, X6443, X6491-X6496, X6442,
X5913/X6109/X5914/X6110 (present in 1995, but deleted in 1998),
X6444-X6455, X6456-X6460, X6461/X6466/X6471/X6476/X6481/X6486,
X6462/X6467/X6472/X6477/X6482/X6487, X6463/X6468/X6473/X6478/X6483/X6488,
X6464/X6469/X6474/X6479/X6484/X6489, X6465/X6470/X6475/X6480/X6485/X6490.

Each of the variables in the main data set has a "shadow" variable that
describes--in almost all cases--the original state of the variable
(i.e., whether it was missing for some reason, a range response was
given, etc.).  The most important exception is reported values which
have been imputed or otherwise altered to protect the privacy of
respondents (see "DISCLOSURE REVIEW" below).  Users who so desire may
use the shadow variables to restore the data to something very close
to their original condition. The shadow variables have the same
numbers as the main variable, but have a prefix of "J."  A list of the
values taken by the shadow variables is given in the section below
entitled "DISCUSSION OF RANGE DATA COLLECTION AND J-CODES."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL DATA CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the SCF data set, a value of zero has only one meaning: that
the item in question is inapplicable.  That is, if a family does not
have a checking account, then the number of checking accounts they own
would be coded as a zero.  Whenever zero is a legitimate response to a
question, a value of -1 is used to signify that value.  Other
specialized codes are defined for each variable in the codebook.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE ID NUMBERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the original numbering system (XX1), important aspects of the
sample design are apparent from the identification numbers.  Because
such information is not releasable under the agreements which allow us
to collect the data, each case included in the public version of the
data set has been given a random identification number (YY1).  Users
should note that it is not possible to know with certainty from the
information provided in the public version of this data set which cases
derive from the list sample.  Because the project staff routinely use
the original numbers internally, users who direct questions to us
about specific cases might want to be sure to emphasize that they are
using the external ID number to avoid confusion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"OTHER" CODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In almost every case where a respondent could supply a response that
did not fit in the codeframe offered to interviewers on their computer
screens, the CAPI program was constructed to allow the entry of a
verbatim response.  There were a few open-ended questions that were
set up to accept only a verbatim response.  All of these responses were
run through a standard coding process at NORC.  Once the data were at
the FRB, strenuous efforts were made to resolve all instances of
responses that were unresolved by the NORC coders.  Responses that
remain coded "other" in the final data set are unusual, but legitimate
responses which do not fit within the existing codeframe; because
these responses appear unlikey to reoccur in future surveys, the
codeframe was not augmented.  Responses that were not informative (or
were not answers to the questions that were asked) were treated as
missing values and were imputed.  An identical process has been followed
since the 1995 SCF.  In earlier surveys, the information recorded for
"other" responses was not as complete, and the efforts to recode the
available verbatim data were somewhat less stringent.  Thus, analysts
should exercise caution in time series comparisons of "other"
responses from the 1995 and later surveys with those in earlier years.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRIDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some sets of questions have a natural iterative pattern.  For example,
the survey asks for detailed information on up to the first six
checking accounts owned by the PEU, and summary information is
collected about all remaining accounts.  The detailed questions are
the same for each account.  In past interviews done with paper and
pencil, some respondents have resisted answering all the detailed
questions and have been willing to provide only summary information.
Typically, interviewers recorded the summary information in the
margins of the questionniare, and editors allocated the data to the
skipped questions according to a set of fixed rules.  To allow for
a variety of respondent-interviewer interactions in the SCF CAPI
program, the grid questions were organized to provide a way of
collecting summary information in a systematic way.  We refer to the
associated summary variables as "mop-up variables."  Past surveys also
indicated that some respondents recalled additional instances of
items once they began answering questions in a grid, but interviewers
often did not revise the originally reported number.  The CAPI
procedures were set up to allow for this possibility as well.

Consider first a respondent who gives a non-missing response to the
question that asks for the number of items of the type to be queried
in the grid.  The interviewer would ask the respondent the first set
of detailed questions on the item.  Then, the interviewer would be
confronted with a question (not to be read to the respondent);

  INTERVIEWER:  CONTINUE, OR GO TO MOPUP OF LOOP?

The intention of this question was to allow the interviewer to deal
with a potentially hostile respondent and immediately branch to the
mop-up questions.  If the respondent was cooperative, the interviewer
entered a CONTINUE response and continued through an identical
procedure for each iteration until either the number of items reported
was exhausted, or the maximum number of detailed questions was asked and
the mop-up question was asked to get summary information on all
remaining items.  If the respondent reported a number of items less
than the maximum number about which the detailed questions are asked,
the following question was asked at the end of the final iteration:

  Do you (or your family living here) have another xxxx?

A YES response here indicates that the respondent recalled an
additional instance in the process of answering the detailed
questions.  A respondent could continue to "add" iterations until the
maximum number of iterations is reached and the mop-up questions are
asked.

Another possibility is that a respondent may either not know (or be
unwilling to tell) the number of instances of an item.  Because it is
known that there is at least one such instance, the first set of
detailed questions is asked.  Then the respondent is asked:

  Do you (or your family living here) have another xxxx?

The questioning then proceedes exactly as it would for a respondent
who recalled additional instances after providing an initial number of
instances.

In processing the data, several steps were taken to attribute the data
collected to their correct location.  First, in some cases interviewers
answered the question "INTERVIEWER:  CONTINUE, OR GO TO MOPUP OF LOOP?"
with the latter response, even though only one more instance remained.
In such cases, the mop-up data were mapped into the appropriate
position in the grid.  This data movement is not directly recorded in
the J-variables for such cases, although the movement can be deduced
from the patterns of J-variables of other questions within the
iteration of the grid that do not have mop-up equivalents: the value
of the J-variables for such variables without mop-up equivalents
would normally be 2052.  Second, when respondents added instances, the
originally reported number was updated and stored in the customary SCF
variable number.  The originally reported number of instances has been
retained in the data set since such information cannot be recovered in
any other way from the data made available.  Third, when summary
information was given by respondents who broke off their responses in
a grid prematurely, that information was used to bound the imputations
of the detailed data.  Data items that have an associated J-variable
with a value of 90 are ones where a complete response was given in the
parallel mop-up variable, and those with a J-variable of 91 are ones
where a range response was given in the parallel mop-up variable.
There are some complicated mixed cases where a respondent gave
a missing value for the number of instances, but was willing to
provide non-missing mop-up data.  Though tedious, it is possible to
deduce this information from the J-variables provided.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY VARIABLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have not included summary variables (e.g., NET WORTH) in the main
data set.  Although it is complicated to construct such variables, it
is our belief that a substantial amount of judgment is involved in
defining variables, and that other analysts should make their own
decisions.  However, as a convenience to users, we have included on
the SCF web site a program written in the SAS language that was used to
create the variables used in the January 2003 Federal Reserve Bulletin
article on the survey and an Excel file containing the summary variables.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A very large amount of time has been spent in searching for errors in
the data and resolving those errors.  Many seeming inconsistencies are
actually in the raw data and appear to have no obvious reconciliation.
Our presumption is always that the respondent understood each question
and reported accurately, and that the process of transcription and
coding did not distort that information.  In cases where other
information led us beyond a reasonable doubt of the validity of the
data, we have changed data, either by altering values directly or by
setting them to missing and imputing them; in all such cases, the
shadow variables indicate that we have overridden reported data (for
an overview of the extent of data changes, see "Measuring Data Quality
In the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances," Arthur B. Kennickell, August
1999, http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  We
ask our colleagues who use this data set to help us in finding any
remaining resolvable inconsistencies.

The imputations for missing data are subject to hierarchical logical
constraints, but otherwise they reflect the fundamental
inconsistencies in the other data.  For example, total income (X5729)
in the reported data is sometimes not equal to the sum of the individual
components (X5702 etc.), so this constraint is not applied to the
imputed data.  Variability in the imputations for a variable in a
given case, sometimes may be large.  This variation is a reflection of
the fundamental uncertainty about the true value of the item.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPUTATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the variables that originally contained a missing value code
have been imputed.  The exceptions include such variables as X6695
(which reports the original number of checking accounts reported by
the survey respondent) and X6504 (which is the interviewer's
description of the property where the respondent lives).  The nature
of any originally missing values may be understood by examining the
J-codes associated with the variables.  The overwhelming majority of
variables that originally contained missing values have been imputed
five times by drawing repeatedly from an estimate of the conditional
distribution of the data.

These imputations are stored as five successive replicates
("implicates") of each data record.  Thus, the number of observations
in the full data set (22,245) is five times the actual number of
respondents (4,449) (see DISCLOSURE REVIEW below for information on
the public version of the data set).  The imputation procedure is
described in "Multiple Imputation in the Survey of Consumer Finances"
(Arthur B. Kennickell, September 1998,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  For a
general discussion of multiple imputation and its uses, see "Multiple
Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys" by Donald B. Rubin, John Wiley
and Sons, 1987.  Multiple imputation offers two distinct advantges
compared with singly-imputed data.  First, because multiple imputation
yields multiple outcomes from a random process, it supports more
efficient estimation than singly-imputed data.  Second, multiple
imputation allows users to make straightforward estimates of the
degree of uncertainty associated with the missing information.

For users who want to estimate only simple statistics such as means
and medians ignoring the effects of imputation error on the standard
errors of these estimates, it will probably be sufficient to divide
the weights by 5.  Software to compute means and medians and their
associated standard errors with respect to imputation and sampling
error is provided in the section on sampling error later in this
codebook.

Users who want to estimate more complex statistics, particularly
regressions, should be cautious in their treatment of the implicates.
Many regression packages will treat each of the five implicates as an
independent observation and correspondingly inflate the reported
significance of results.  Users who want to calculate regression
estimates, but who have no immediate use for proper significance
tests, could either average the dependent and independent values
across the implicates or multiply their standard errors by the square
root of five.  For an easily understandable discussion of multiple
imputation in the SCF from a user's point of view, see Catherine
Montalto and Jaimie Sung, "Multiple Imputation in the 1992 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 7, 1996,
pages 133-146 (or on the Internet at 
http://hec.osu.edu/people/shanna/imput.htm).  That article also
contains a set of simple SAS macros to use to compute correct standard
errors from multiply imputed data.  Two alternatives for processing
general model estimates are offered here, one written in SAS (MACRO
MISECOMP) and the other in Stata (StataMIcode.do).

DISCUSSION OF RANGE DATA COLLECTION AND J-CODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the 1995 SCF, the CAPI program has allowed interviewers a
variety of ways to enter partial information (for a detailed
description and analysis of range data in the 1995 survey, see "Using
Range Techniques with CAPI in the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances,"
Arthur B. Kennickell, January 1997,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  In the
past, we had evidence that some respondents volunteered figures in
ranges.  Good interviewers have always tried to get respondents to
settle on a single "best" figure, but sometimes it may be that there
is no firm figure (e.g., the value of a privately-held business
may be known only at the point it is actually sold) and probing too
far could cause the respondent to answer "don't know" or to refuse to
answer.  The CAPI program allows such responses to be reported in
ranges volunteered by respondents.  There is another class of
respondents who may not volunteer a range, who do not know (or will
not give) an exact figure, but who will give some information about
the value.  To obtain information from this second group of people,
the CAPI program includes two options. First, a respondent who is
uncomfortable actually saying an amount may report a letter from a
card that specifies a number of ranges.  The range card has been used
very successfully in earlier waves of the SCF, but CAPI allows the
option to be presented consistently.  Second, a respondent who
declines the use of the range card is asked a series of questions in a
"decision tree" that are designed to specify a range.  The dollar
breaks in the decision tree vary by question (so that, for example,
monthly rent is not subject to the same ranges as the value of
corporate stock).  The computer sequences used for range followup for
all dollar values in the survey (known as "DKDOL") are outlined
schematically in a section below.  It should be noted that
interviewers were strongly instructed that a single dollar value is
the best answer to each of these questions.  Although there is the
distinct possibility that respondents may become "trained" in the use
of the range questions during the course of the interview (the effect
of this training is unclear at present: respondents may tend to report
"too many" ranges because they know that they are allowed;
alternatively, respondents may learn that it is much quicker to give a
single dollar figure), interviewers should be using all of the
standard techniques to get respondents to give a single figure where
possible.  Evidence from the 1995 SCF suggests that this approach
dramatically reduces the frequency of "don't know" responses, but it
has little effect on refusals.  Although the overall proportion of
respondents reporting no information is much lower, generally the
proportion providing complete responses declined.

Schematic diagram of sequence used for all dollar questions:

                 Qnn.  How much is your [******]?

level 1:  $________  $___RANGE             $______DK       $__Refuse

level 2:  Confirm    Range card                   Give a range?
                     or dollar range?

                     RC      DR            YES                NO/DK     Refuse

level 3:  OUT        Letter  Upper bound   Letter/Own range   Decision

level 6:                                   OUT     OUT

(OUT=proceed to next question)

At the first level, the respondent has the option of providing a
dollar amount (interviewers were strongly urged to obtain a single
dollar value where possible), volunteering a range, answering "don't
know," or refusing to answer.  Each of these responses implies a
different sequence of questions.  In the case of a single dollar
figure, the CAPI program displays in words the number the interviewer
has typed into the computer and proceeds to the next question.  If the
respondent volunteers a range, there is an option to report either a
range in dollars (in some cases the upper or lower bound of a
range may be missing--e.g., as in the case where a respondent answers
"greater than a million dollars") or to give a letter from a range
card (the ranges are given below).  If the respondent answers "don't
know" or refuses to answer, the program will request a range; if
the respondent agrees, the program will accept the same types of
ranges that may be volunteered directly from the initial dollar
screen.  If the respondent is unable to provide a range in this way (that
is the respondent answers "no" or "don't know"), the program presents
a series of questions known as a "decision tree," which is specified
in greater detail below.  If the respondent refuses when asked to use
the range card, the program proceeds to the next question.  The exact
question text for this sequence is given below.

Because of software limitations, negative ranges presented a special
problem.  It was not feasible to build in negative ranges directly.
As a compromise, interviewers were instructed to collect the ranges in
absolute values and record in a comment box available in the program
the fact that the range was negative.

If R volunteers a range at level 1, the following is displayed at
level 2:

     CHOOSE: 

     ENTER LETTER FROM RANGE CARD
     R WILL GIVE RANGE

  If the range card option is chosen, the screen displays:

     ENTER LETTER FROM RANGE CARD:

  and any of the following letters on the range card may be entered:

               A    ......    $1 - $100
               B    ......    $101 - $500
               C    ......    $501 - $1,000
               D    ......    $1,001 - $2,500
               E    ......    $2,501 - $5,000
               F    ......    $5,001 - $7,500
               G    ......    $7,501 - $10,000
               H    ......    $10,001 - $25,000
               I    ......    $25,001 - $50,000
               J    ......    $50,001 - $75,000
               K    ......    $75,001 - $100,000
               L    ......    $100,001 - $250,000
               M    ......    $250,001 - $500,000
               N    ......    $500,001 - $1 million
               O    ......    $1 million - $5 million
               P    ......    $5 million - $10 million
               Q    ......    $10 million - $25 million
               R    ......    $25 million - $50 million
               S    ......    $50 million - $100 million
               T    ......    More than $100 million


  If R offers to give a dollar range, the screen displays:

     ENTER LOW END OF RANGE :  $___,___,___.__

     ENTER HIGH END OF RANGE : $___,___,___.__

  Whichever type of range is selected, after the range information is
  entered, the program skips to the confirmation screen.

If R answers "don't know" or "refuse" at level 1, the following text
is presented:

     Can you give me a range?

     YES
     NO/DK

  If YES is chosen, the sequence is as given above for directly
  volunteered ranges.

  If R refuses at this point, the program skips directly to the
  confirmation screen.  If the R answers DK and the interviewer selects
  the function key for this value rather than the screen code "NO/DK",
  then the program skips to the confirmation screen.

  If R answers "no/don't know", level three is a decision tree
  designed to guide the R into a range response where possible.

    In the decision tree, respondents are asked a series of questions
    to bound the true response within an interval.  The intervals are
    defined in terms of seven values; let those values be denoted
    generically by V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7.  The questions asked
    take the following form:

     Q1.  Was it V4 dollars or more?

               YES --> GO TO Q2
               NO, DK --> GO TO Q5
               Ref --> EXIT

     Q2.  Was it V5 dollars or more?

               YES --> GO TO Q3
               NO, DK, Ref --> EXIT

     Q3.  Was it V6 dollars or more?

               YES --> GO TO Q4
               NO, DK, Ref --> EXIT

     Q4.  Was it V7 dollars or more?

               YES, NO, DK, Ref --> EXIT
     
     Q5.  Was it V1 dollars or more?

               YES --> GO TO Q6
               NO, DK, Ref --> EXIT

     Q6.  Was it V2 dollars or more?

               YES --> GO TO Q7
               NO, DK, Ref --> EXIT

     Q7.  Was it V3 dollars or more?

               YES, NO, DK, Ref --> EXIT


    To allow for appropriate ranges for all dollar questions, there are
    eight different versions of the V1 to V7 variables given below.

Version     V1     V2       V3       V4         V5         V6          V7
   1     10,000  100,000  250,000  500,000    1,000,000  5,000,000   10,000,000
   2     50,000  100,000  500,000  1,000,000  5,000,000  10,000,000  25,000,000
   3     50,000  100,000  150,000  250,000    500,000    1,000,000   5,000,000 
   4     5,000   25,000   50,000   100,000    250,000    500,000     1,000,000 
   5     5,000   10,000   25,000   50,000     100,000    250,000     750,000  
   6     500     1,000    5,000    10,000     25,000     75,000      250,000  
   7     100     250      500      1,000      2,000      10,000      50,000   
   8     50      100      250      500        1,000      5,000       10,000   

    There are 22 possible unique outcomes of each version of each of the 8
    versions of the decision tree:

    1. Q1=NO, Q5=NO
    2. Q1=NO, Q5=DK
    3. Q1=NO, Q5=Ref
    4. Q1=NO, Q5=YES, Q6=NO
    5. Q1=NO, Q5=YES, Q6=DK
    6. Q1=NO, Q5=YES, Q6=Ref
    7. Q1=NO, Q5=YES, Q6=YES, Q7=NO
    8. Q1=NO, Q5=YES, Q6=YES, Q7=DK
    9. Q1=NO, Q5=YES, Q6=YES, Q7=Ref
    10. Q1=NO, Q5=YES, Q6=YES, Q7=YES
    11. Q1=YES, Q2=NO
    12. Q1=YES, Q2=DK

    21. Q1=Ref---> NOTE: RESULTS IN NO BOUNDING INFORMATION
    22. Q1=DK ---> NOTE: RESULTS IN NO BOUNDING INFORMATION

    If R answers "don't know" or "refuse" at any point in the decision
    tree, the program skips to the confirmation screen.

The confirmation screen:

  Where the R has given a complete dollar response the confirmation
  screen displays:

    I would like to confirm that that amount is... (amount in words)

  Where the R has given a a letter from the range card, the confirmation
  screen displays:

    I would like to confirm that is range card letter ___.

  If the R gives any other type of response, the confirmation screen
  displays relevant information for the interviewer to determine that
  the information provided has been entered correctly.

  If an error in data entry is detected on the confirmation screen,
  interviewers are asked to correct the data.

*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;

The shadow variables fall into three large groups.  Codes of less than
90 indicate that data were not originally missing (or that they could
be inferred with high confidence from other information).  Codes
with an integer value from 90 through 996 indicate that the respondent
provided a range response.  The extensive form of the paths through
the range routines encompasses a large number of outcomes, as is
reflected in the number of possible range codes.  For the codes that
indicate a range response, there may also be a decimal component.  A
code with a decimal part equal to 0.5 indicates that the initial
response that the respondent gave to the associated dollar question
was "don't know."  In every other case, there should be no decimal
component to the shadow variable.  Codes of 997 or more indicate that
the associated data value is completely missing.

There is an important exception to the normal assignment of J-codes.
In some cases, it is not known where a reported value should actually
be reported, because a higher-order question was missing.  In setting
up the data for further processing, such reported values are put into
variable locations where it might have been appropriate for the
response to have been given had the higher-order variable not been
missing; the original J-code for the reported data is retained in all
locations.  Imputation determines a path through the data, and the
values which are imputed to be inapplicable are given a value of zero,
even though their J-codes are not necessarily one of the codes for
inapplicable data (1, 3 or 14).

When columns of a grid need to be shifted after data are removed, the
moved variables retain their original J-codes.

*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
Definitions of the "J" Variables (2001 version)

0  = Originally reported value.  See above for an exception.

1  = Question is inapplicable (e.g., R has no checking account
     so value of checking account is coded as zero.)  NOTE: all
     values of zero in the data set are in some sense inapplicable
     [also see J-code value 14]; reported values of zero are
     typically stored as -1.

2  = Data taken from (or moved from) another location (e.g., a
     motorcycle misclassified in the automobile grid moved to the
     other vehicle grid); data moved from another location and added
     to data already at the new location (e.g., wage income from
     spouse reported in independent adult part of section Y added to
     data reported for R in Section T); data reported in a "mop-up"
     field that could be directly mapped into the correct final
     location.  These moves and changes may be the result of verbatim
     responses, interviewer comment, or other information.

4  = CAPI error: resolution yields a non-missing (non-range) value.

5  = Indicates a value coded directly by FRB from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response or interviewer comments that
     translate directly into a valid response.  Such values indicate
     the exercise of a bare minimum of judgment in encoding the
     content of the text data.  ("Super-no" corrections are included
     here.)
6  = Indicates a value coded directly by NORC from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response.

8  = variable computed from other non-missing variables.

9  = variable overridden by logically equivalent information to
     maintain consistency of data (e.g., when type of property is a
     time share (X1703=25), but R says they own the share alone
     (X1704=1)--rather than saying that the property is a time share
     (X1704=5)--then the response to X1704 is changed to 5).

10 = This code applies to variables where part of the value
     reported should have been (or was) also reported elsewhere and is
     edited out here (e.g., in the case where the wage income of NPEU
     member is reported at X6403 and at X5702 along with income of
     the PEU, the NPEU value is removed from X5702 and J5702=10).

11 = Assumption made in CAPI program to guide questions dependent on
     marital history (applies at X107 only): value originally answered
     "don't know" or "refuse".
12 = Assumption made in CAPI program to guide questions dependent on
     marital history (applies at X107 and X7020 only); except code 11.
     Question not directly asked.

13 = Judgmental override of non-missing reported value.
14 = Inapplicable code generated by any data adjustment,
     (particularly adjustments associated with J-codes 2, 10, 13, 15,
     16, and 17).
15 = Non-stochastic imputation of missing data (typically based at
     least in part on other, non-codeable data).
16 = Override of reported data based on comment/verbatim information
     or information from another question (e.g., X7360)
     (other than codes 2, 5, and 13).  Assigment of this value
     requires both text (verbatim/comment) data and significant
     judgment, or substantial structural information from other
     reported values together with judgment.
17 = Value of originally missing data item implied by/computed from
     other variable(s).  Relatively more judgement is implied by this
     code than a code 8.

25 = This code is used only for the make/model of vehicles.  If either
     the make or the model (but not both) was originally missing, but
     there was sufficient information to approximate the value of the
     vehicle, this code is assigned.

30 = Respondent agreed to provide a dollar range as a response
     (either as a directly volunteered range or in response to the
     question soliciting a range after an intial response or "don't
     know" or "refuse"), but the upper and lower bounds of the range
     given were identical.

ALL RESPONSES THAT FOLLOW HAVE AT LEAST SOME MISSING INFORMATION

90 = Bounding information available based on summary information
     provided by respondent (typically, if a R does not know
     information about items beyond a certain number in a set of
     detailed questions about a larger number of such items, the R is
     asked one or a number of summary questions about all remaining
     instances).
91 = Same as 90, but R gave range data for the summary information.

OTHER CODES FOR MISSING DATA

2050 = Original response was DK.

     a way as to render the response appropriate.  Also includes some
     other miscellaneous cases: (1) if a dollar variable was missing
     and DKDOL returned a DK/REF, the corresponding frequency is given
     a missing value code equal to that of the dollar field; (2)
     similarly, for clusters of variables containing a dollar amount
     and percent options.
2053 = Original response was refused
2054 = Original response was "some, DK how many" (see B6).

2056 = Missing value determined from verbatim response by NORC coders.

2060 = Unresolved data problem (none should remain in final data set).

2079 = Data missing because of questionnaire error, or data not collected.

       sub-group, data to be imputed.
2081 = Recode variable, some, but not all components originally missing.
2082 = Recode variable, all components originally missing.

2097 = Override of reported information with (at least partially)
       imputed data
2098 = Override of reported/inap./other information with a missing value.

2099 = Used for absent spouse for J104 or J105 when X104 or X105 < 0.

3000 = Data missing because R broke off the interview (each of these
       cases reviewed to be sure that sufficient information is
       reported that the case can count as a "partial accepted as
       complete")

3001 = Program, reporting or recording error.

3002 = Temporary value given to variables containing illegal values.
       These will all be resolved in editing and converted to other
       existing codes.  (includes "range U")

3003 = Illegal zeroes

3004 = Uninformative/irrelevant verbatim response

3005 = Data not available (applies to data from HEF)

3500 = Data set to missing and imputed for disclosure avoidance

General instructions for J variable coding for recoded variables:
  When a recoded variable is taken directly from another single
    X-variable, it should have the same J-variable code.
  When a recoded variable may come from a single variable in the
    original X-variables, or as the result of a calculation based on
    some number of X-variables, it is important to distinguish the
    information content in the J-variables.  As noted above, when the
    value is taken directly, the J-variable should have exactly the
    same value as that for the X-variable's shadow J-variable.
    However, when some calculation is involved, this should be
    reflected in the J-variable -- codes 8, 2081, and 2082.
  When a recoded variable cannot be computed because some part of the
  underlying information was not collected for some subset of cases,
  the recoded variable's J-variable should be coded 9 or 2080.

ANALYSIS WEIGHTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the SCF sample is not an equal-probability design, weights
play a critical role in interpreting the survey data.  The main
data set contains the final nonresponse-adjusted sampling weights.
These weights are intended to compensate for unequal probabilities of
selection in the original design and for unit nonresponse (failure to
obtain an interview).  The weight (X42001) is a partially design-based
weight constructed at the Federal Reserve using original selection
probabilities and frame information along with aggregate control
totals estimated from the Current Population Survey.  This weight is a
relatively minor revision of the consistent weight series (X42000)
maintained for the SCFs beginning with 1989 (For a detailed discussion
of these weights, see "Consistent Weight Design for the 1989, 1992,
and 1995 SCFs and the Distribution of Wealth," by Arthur B. Kennickell
and R. Louise Woodburn, Review of Income and Wealth, Series 45, Number
2, June 1999, pp. 193-215 or the longer version given on the SCF web
site at http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  The
nature of the revisions to the consistent weights is described in
"Revisions to the SCF Weighting Methodology: Accounting for
Race/Ethnicity and Homeownership" (Arthur B. Kennickell, January 1999,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  A version
of the revised weight has been computed for all the surveys beginning
with 1989, and this variable has been added to the public versions of
the SCF data sets.  Users should be aware that the population defined
by the weights for *each implicate* (see above) is 106.5 million
households: the sum of each of the weights over all sample cases and
imputation replicates is equal to five times the number of households
in the sample universe.

Although the weights should produce reliable results at the level of
broad aggregates (e.g., net worth and income ), it is important to
note that many of the variables collected in the SCF are highly
skewed in their distributions and that many such variables will apply
to only a relatively small fraction of the sample; thus, estimates of
characterstics of such variables may be distorted by outliers.  In the
SCF group at the Federal Reserve, we routinely review our calculations
for the presence of overly-influential outliers, and robust techniques
are applied when appropriate.  We encourage other users to exercise
similar care in analyzing the data.

The issue of weighting in regressions has long been controversial.
Users of the SCF may find two references particularly useful:
(1) Analysis of Complex Surveys, C.J. Skinner, D. Holt, and
T.M.F. Smith (editors), John Wiley and Sons, 1989 (see particularly
pages 8-10, 154-157, and 286-287). (2) The Analysis of Household
Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy, Angus
Deaton, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997 (see particularly pages
67-73).  At the least, users should think carefully about the effects
of weights in their particular models.  Weighted estimates may be
dramatically less efficient than unweighted estimates.  If one is
interested in estimating descriptions of the population--rather than
"structural models"--there are some clear justifications for
weighting.  If weights make a substantial difference in regression
estimates, analysts may want to consider the possibily that their
models omit some key structure that could be controlled for in a way
other than weighting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLING ERROR
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SCF is a scientific instrument designed for the measurement of
behavior.  However, even under ideal operational conditions, the
measurements of the survey are limited in a fundamental way by the
fact that it is based on a sample of respondents rather than the
entire population.  Variability of estimates based on sample data can
be estimated.

Because we are unable to give users any of the most basic sample
information about cases in the data set, they would be unable on their
own to compute reasonable estimates of the sampling variances of their
estimates.  To facilitate such estimation, we have included a file
of replicate weights and multiplicity factors corresponding to
X42001.  Using detailed information about the original sample design, 
we selected 999 sample replicates from the final set of completed
cases in a way intended to capture the important dimensions of sample 
variation (for details see "Weighting design for the 1992 Survey of 
Consumer Finances," Arthur Kennickell, Douglas McManus and Louise 
Woodburn, December 1996, http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/
method.html).  For each survey case and each replicate, the file
contains a weight (WT1B1-WT1B999) and the number of times the case 
was selected in the replicate (MM1-MM999).  We computed weights for 
each replicate using exactly the same procedures we used for the main 
weights.  Replicate weights were computed only for the first implicate 
of each case.  For many purposes, users will probably want to multiply 
the weight times the multiplicity: in all cases the sum of each of the 
weights times the corresponding multiplicities of the cases equals the 
total number of households.  To estimate the sampling variance of the 
mean of family income, for example, a user would estimate the mean 
999 times using the replicate weights and compute the standard error 
of that estimate.  An estimate of the total standard error
attributable to imputation and sampling is given by
SQRT((6/5)*imputation variance + sampling variance).

A simple SAS program to compute the standard error due to sampling and
imputation for the mean and median of a given variable is provided
below.  This program may be adapted easily for other types of
calculations.  For example, to compute the standard error of a
proportion, create a zero/one dummy variable to indicate the presence
of the item; the standard error of the mean will be the correct
standard error of the proportion.  To conserve on necessary memory,
the program computes sampling error using blocks of 100 replicate
weights rather than the full set at once.  Users with large amounts of
RAM may wish to increase the size of these blocks, and those with
smaller amounts may wish to decrease the size.

    * WARNING: this MACRO is not intended to be used with subsets
      of the full survey data where the population total varies
      across subsetted implicates: to use this MACRO to make
      calculations for a subset of the full data set, invoke the WHERE
      statement;
    * NOTE: the calculation excludes observations with missing values
      from the calculation.  Thus, if one wants to make the
      calculation for only non-INAP values, a convenient short cut
      might be to set all such values (normally zero in the main SCF
      database) to a missing value (a WHERE condition would also
      work).  The program assumes that missing value patterns are
      consistent across implicates--if this is not the case, a WHERE
      condition should be used;
    * WARNING: if one uses this MACRO to compute variances for very
      small sub-populations, there is a chance that some of the
      replicates may contain no cases where the condition defining the
      sub-population holds.  In this case, the program will return a

DISCLOSURE REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A paramount goal of the survey is to protect the privacy of the
participants, who generously shared their personal information.
In light of this goal, the data in this release have been
systematically altered by several means to minimize the possibility of
identifying any survey respondent.  For some discrete variables, small
or unusual cells were collapsed as noted in the individual variable
descriptions below.  Continuous variables were rounded.  Data were
also blurred by other means intentionally not specified.  In addition,
a number of other cases were identified for more extensive treatment.
Some of these cases were selected on the basis of extreme or unusual
data values; other cases were selected at random.  For each of these
cases, a selection of critical variables was set to missing and
statistically imputed subject to constraints designed to ensure that
any distortions induced in key population statistics would be minimal.
Where relevant, the codebook provides more detailed information on
cell collapsing and other techniques.

By design, the SCF sample excludes people who are included in the
Forbes Magazine list of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. (see
references in "SAMPLE DESIGN" above).  However, there are several
reasons why respondents with wealth at this level could appear in the
sample anyway.  In the 2001 survey, there were 7 observations that
had net worth at least equal to the minumum level needed to qualify
for the Forbes list.  Because it would be very difficult to obscure
sufficiently the identity of such people without rendering their data
virtually useless, it was decided to remove them from the public
version of the datset.  Thus, the public version of the data set
contains 4,442 of the 4,449 observations in the full data set.

It is important to note that aside from the cell collapsing, there is
no key in this codebook or in the data set that would allow users to
identify with certainty either which data items have been smoothed or
otherwise altered, or which cases were selected for imputation of
critical values (that is, the shadow variables in this data set may not
always reflect the true original status of every variable).  Although
this blurring of the data will have some effect on analysis, that
effect should be negligible in most cases.  For further details
on the procedures taken to protect the identity of respondents, see
"Analyzing the Disclosure Review Procedures for the 1995 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Gerhard Fries, Barry W. Johnson, and R. Louise
Woodburn, September 1997,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html) and
"Multiple Impution and Disclosure Protection: The Case of the 1995
SCF" (Arthur B. Kennickell, November 1997,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  The
disclosure protections applied to the data are the product of an
agreement between the Federal Reserve Board, NORC, and SOI.  Users who
feel that the restrictions imposed on the public data set are too
constricting are encouraged to submit written proposals for expanded
data release, and those requests will be given serious consideration
in the release of data from future surveys.

Note that dollar variables, except X3918 and X3920, in the public 
data set have been rounded according to the following scheme which
preserves the population mean on average:

COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, medians of financial characteristics estimated from the
SCF should compare well with medians estimated from other surveys
using comparable population definitions.  However, estimates of means
will often differ, largely for two reasons.  First, means of many
financial characteristics may not be very robustly estimated in
surveys that interview only a relatively small number of wealthy
households.  The distribution of many financial characteristics (e.g.,
net worth) is highly skewed, and sparce representation of the upper
tail will translate into a noisy estimate of statistics, such as the
mean, that are strongly affected by the top of the distribution.
Second, there may also be a degree of bias in the measurement of some
financial characteristics.  Evidence suggests that there is
differentially higher nonresponse among wealthy households.  Failure
to account for such differences in the creation of analysis weights
leads to a misrepresentation of the size of the upper tail of wealth
and characterstics associated with being in that tail.  By using frame
data for the list sample, the SCF has the means to identify and make
some corrections for such nonresponse.  However, this option is not
available in most other surveys.

The SCF may also be compared with aggregate statistics, such as the
flow of funds accounts (FFA), which are constructed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  An extensive analysis of the
differences in these two sources is provided by Rochelle Antoniewicz
("A Comparison of the Household Sector from the Flow of Funds Accounts
and the Survey of Consumer Finances," October 2000,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).
As discussed in that paper in detail, there are many conceptual
differences between the SCF and the FFA.  Three of these differences are
particularly noteworthy here.  First, the FFA "household sector"
includes the holdings of nonprofits, and estimates of those holdings
must be made to create a population basis closer to that used in the
SCF.  Second, the financial concepts used in the FFA often differ from
those used in the SCF.  Substantial effort is usually required to
align the concepts in the two sources, and in some cases there is no
clear way of doing so.  Third, both the FFA and the SCF provide
statistical estimates.  Because the two series are developed from
independent sources of information with different statistical
properties, it would be surprising if they yielded precisely the same
totals even if the populations and concepts could be made perfectly
consistent.

The SCF is a large project that involves intense commitment by many
people.  At the Federal Reserve, the main project staff involved with
the creation of the data included Ana Aizcorbe, Ryan Bledsoe,
Gerhard Fries, Arthur Kennickell, Kevin Moore, and Brooke Wells.
Important support has come from the FRB officer corps, particulary
Edward Ettin and Myron Kwast who have invested their credibility in
making the project possible.  In addition to funding the survey, the
individual members of the Board of Governors have actively encouraged
the development and use of the survey.  Support from the Statistics of
Income Division at the IRS has been essential. Barry Johnson has been
tireless in his work to obtain the necessary data for the selection of
the list sample, in his work on the disclosure review, and in sharing
the insights he has gained in working with the IRS estate tax data.
Nicholas Greenia, the confidentiality officer for SOI, was
particularly helpful in negotiating permission to receive the data
necessary for the 2001 sample.  Thomas Petska, the director of SOI,
and James Nunns at the Office of Tax Analysis at the Department of the
Treasury have encouraged and supported us through many difficult
periods.

At NORC, very many people have touched the project in important ways.
In very early stages of the 2001 project, Mary Hess and Paul Pulliam
each served briefly as Project Director.  Catherine Haggerty was the
Project Director through most of the design phase and all the
execution phase of the project; the level of her commitment to the
project and the goal of collecting high-quality data was very
remarkable.  The Associate Director was Robert Bailey.  Jim Carr,
Melissa Rajan, and Karen Veldman served as coordinators in the central
office for each of the major regions of the field.  Suzanne Bard was
the field liaison in the central office.  Linda Wiedmer, served as the
data collection task leader.  Julie Feldman, Myrna Lundy, and Barbara
Watt served as the regional field project managers.  The field
managers were Mary Allen, Madeline Bartleman, Pat Bass, Lee Cook,
Paula Dilley, Sally Harrison, Carol Kasdorf, MJ Knight, Nondice
McFall, Susan Miller, Nancy Mutz, Donna Rader, Karen Rockwell, and
Mary Sudheimer.  Phil Panczuk built on the work of Geoff Walker and
Val Cooke in revising the CAPI program for the survey.  Angela
Herrmann was the coordinator or all mailings to and from the field.
Coding of verbatim responses was supervised by Victoria Sudler, and
the coding was performed by Renee Adams, Patricia M. Armstrong,
Carolyn Caldwell, Doris Covington, Charron Davis, Everlee Hoskin,
Darius Stroud, Asia Wilder, Betty Sue Williams, and Jennifer Zanders.
Syed Ahsan developed the software used to manage the coding operation
and ensure consistency in coding.   Mike Crifassi developed many of
the data handling systems used to process the data received from the
interviewers.  Others in the central office who made particularly
important contributions were Barbara Bailar, Suzanne Bard, Craig
Coelen, Jack Covington, Dick Rubin, Micah Sjoblom, Michael Tilkin, Joe
Taylor, and Charlene Weiss.  I apologize to everyone else in the
central office at NORC who worked on the survey for not making this
list longer.  Donna Berry, Carol Kasdorf, Anne Dietrich, Theresa
Gordon served as interviewers for the pretest of the survey instrument
and procedures.  The interviewers for the main field work, some of
whom may prefer not to be named, were the people who did the hardest
work.  In 2001, the field team included many experienced
interviewers--some on earlier SCFs--and others from a wide variety of
backgrounds.  They deserve the deep gratitude of users of the SCF
data.  The largest debt is owed to the survey respondents, who are
necessarily anonymous.  May every user remember that some person gave
his or her time in the public interest to create the data that make
their analysis possible.  No set of acknowledgements would be complete
without mentioning three people: Fritz Scheuren, who provided early
and continuing encouragement, insights, and support for the SCF
project; Robert Avery, my predecessor as director of the SCF, is a
colleague who not only created the atmosphere that made the current
development of the project possible, but who continues to contribute
as a sounding board for our ideas; and Dorothy S. Projector, project
director of the Federal Reserve's landmark 1962-63 Survey of Financial
Characteristics of Consumers, set a very high standard for all future
work on household wealth surveys.

X42000    Original Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight.  


X42001    Revised Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight: accounts for
          systemative deviations from CPS estimates of homeownership
          by racial/ethnic Groups.  This weight should be used for all
          estimations using the final 2001 SCF data for which weights
          are appropriate.

REPLICATE WEIGHTS AND MULTIPLICITY FACTORS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the introduction, there is an additional data file
which contains replicate weights and multiplicity factors to be used in
estimating sampling variances.  The file corresponds to the main
weight X42001.

The replicate weights are of the form WT1Bi, where i=1,...999
The multiplicity factors are of the form MMi, where i=1,...999

Replicate weights with a given index correspond to multiplicity
factors with the same index.

           In the 2001 SCF, the definitions used in determining
           whether a spouse or partner is a part of the primary
           economic unit changed somewhat from earlier SCFs.  Most of
           these changes affect small groups of the population.  Two
           groups account for most of the changes.  First, cases where
           the respondent intially reports being married, but the
           spouse is not there (or it is questionable whether the
           spouse is there) and does not share in the finances of the
           unit (or it is questionable whether the spouse does so).
           The second group is a roughly comparable group of partners.
           Where respondents have not been willing to answer questions
           about the presence of spouses or partner, default
           assumptions were made.

X7019      The following variable summarizes the sets of possible martial
           arrangements and specifies the assumption about whether a
           spouse or partner is included in the primary economic unit.
           The information used in this classification is based on the
           answers of the original respondent; when X8000=5, this
           information is contained in the first position of the
           household listing variables below, and when X8000=1 the
           information in the second position was used.
           Note that unlike the case with other variables in the main
           interview, variables in the initial household listing
           describing the respondent's marital status are not imputed.

            For example, a respondent may have answered "married" to

            this case, the variable has been recoded coded "partner":

            1.  *YES
            5.  *NO


X305       The next few questions are about the financial
           institutions that you do business with. 

           With how many financial institutions do you currently have
           accounts or loans, or regularly do personal financial
           business?  Include banks, savings and loans, credit unions,
           brokerages, loan companies, and so forth, but not
           institutions where you have only credit cards or business
           accounts.

           With how many financial institutions do you and your family
           living here currently have accounts or loans, or regularly
           do personal financial business?  Include banks, savings and
           loans, credit unions, brokerages, loan companies, and so
           forth, but not institutions where you have only credit
           cards or business accounts.

X8300      Inferred number of institutions.  When institutions were
           reported (or in some cases, imputed) after the institution
           data were collected (except in the case of bank-type credit
           cards) the CAPI program returned to the institution
           questions for the added institutions.  In some cases,
           interviewers failed to enter the new institution properly,
           so the followup questions were not generated by the CAPI
           program.  X8300 takes the originally reported value of X305
           as its base and adds additional institutions whenever a
           commercial bank, savings and loan, credit union, or
           brokerage was reported without an initial link to the
           institution data.  Where there were more than the 6
           institutions on which detailed information was collected,
           the total number of institutions was augmented and stored
           in X8300.  In cases where any of the first six institutions
           have been inferred from an interviewer error, the detailed
           information (location and how R does business) has been
           imputed.

           Code NUMBER
           -1.  NONE


           Institutions were enumerated by name, and the name was used
           as a text fill later in the interview when, e.g., the R was
           asked to identify the institution where the main checking
           account was held.  To protect the privacy of respondents,
           this variable was not retained in the data set.

           (What is the name of this financial institution?/
           What is the name of the financial institution where you do
           the most business?/What is the name of the financial
           institution where you and your family living here do the
           most business?)

           [What is the name of the financial institution where you do
           the  (second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth) most business?/
           What is the name of the financial institution where you and
           your family living here do the (second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth)
           most business?

           Once the program had generated questions about the number
           of institutions specified by X305, the program asked:

           Do you have any other financial institutions which we have not
           listed yet?
           (Have you included all your accounts?/Have you included the
           accounts for all the people in your household?)

           If the R recalled an additional account, the program was
           set up to augment the list of institutions until the
           respondent said there were no more.

           If X305 contained a value that indicated that there were
           accounts, but the number was a missing value, the R was
           asked:

X6707      Recode: The number of the first institiution added after
           the initial enumeration.

           Code number
           -1.  No institutions added

X308(#1)   (SHOW CARD 3) About (name of institution), what kind of
X312(#2)   institution is this?  (Is it a commercial bank, a savings 
X316(#3)   and loan or savings bank, a credit union, a finance or loan 
X320(#4)   company, a brokerage, or what?)
X324(#5)
X328(#6)   Now, I need a little more information on the institutions
           we've added to the card since the start of the interview.

           program generated the detailed questions on those
           institutions after the section on financial assets was

           are labeled "Recode: type of institution".  In these
           locations, the preceding question asks the respondent
           whether the institution where a loan/account is held is
           the same as one of the ones originally recorded in the
           sequence here.  If it was one of these, the interviewer
           entered a link to the appropriate institution.  If it was a
           new institution and there were fewer than six institutions
           already listed, the interviewer was instructed to follow a
           procedure to add the institution to the existing list of
           institutions.  Once six institutions were recorded in the
           list, the interviewer could either link to an institution
           that had already been recorded or code an institution type
           (e.g., commercial bank).  For the cases where a link was
           made to one of the listed institutions, the recode
           variable contains a code for the institution type obtained
           from matching to the sequence of variables described here.
           Where the institution was one that was outside the scope of
           the list, the recode variable contains a code for the
           institution type as asked directly from the respondent.

           NOTE: Examination of the data suggests that a relatively
           small number of respondents reported that their mortgage
           institution was a finance company and some others reported
           that it was a brokerage.  Examination of the name of the
           institution, which is available for most cases in a
           non-public internal data set, suggests that the respondent
           misclassified a mortgage company or mortgage broker.

IRA/KEOGH ACCOUNTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
           As we continue through the interview, I will be asking you 
           about several types of retirement assets you may have, such
           as Keoghs, IRAs or "Individual Retirement Accounts,"
	   annuities, and pensions and retirement accounts you have
	   through a current or past job.

           Here I would like to ask just about IRAs and Keogh
           accounts.  These may include accounts you set up on your
           own as well as retirement accounts that you "rolled over"
           into an IRA after leaving a previous job.
           (SHOW CARD 17)

           INCLUDE ROTH AND EDUCATION IRAs HERE.
           IRA-SEP AND IRA-SIMPLE ARE EMPLOYER-SPONSORED PLANS, AND

           and group policies, but not accident insurance.

           Do you or anyone in your family living here have any life

            5.  *NO


X4002      The two major types of life insurance are term and
           cash-value policies.  Term policies pay a benefit if the
           insured person dies, but otherwise have no value.  They are
           often provided through an employer or union, but may also
           be bought by individuals.  Cash-value policies also pay a
           death benefit, but differ in that they build up a value as
           premimums are paid.  Other names for types of cash value
           policies are "whole life" and "universal life."

           Are any of your policies individual term insurance?

If R reported having life insurance (X4001=1), but reports no term
insurance (X4002=5) and no whole life insurance (X4004=5), then the
CAPI program asked R the total face value of all types of life
insurance.  R might also have reported having term insurance, DK
whether other insurance is whole life but still know the face value or
the remaining insurance.  If an amount was provided, it was used as a
constraint on the imputation of the sum of the face value of term and
cash value life insurance.

           value of all the life insurance you own?

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working fewer than 20 hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
           these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
           [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
           if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
           occupation.

X4203(#1a)  (SHOW CARD 19)
X4303(#1b)  I would like to know what general type of plan this is.
X4403(#1c)  In one common type of pension or retirement plan, the monthly
X4803(#2a)  retirement benefit paid is based on a formula usually
X4903(#2b)  involving age, years of service, and salary.  In other
X5003(#2c)  plans, money is accumulated in an account for
            (you/her/him) until (your/her/his) retirement.  Is this
            plan like the formula plan or account plan?

             1.  *FORMULA
             2.  *ACCOUNT
             3.  *COMBINATION OF BOTH TYPES

                 where not currently drawing benefits: X4141=5/X4741=5;

                 X4201<2/X4801<2/fewer than 3 pensions: X4201<3/X4801<3)

            NOTE: CARD 19 contained the three large blocks of text
            centered in a vertical column: Under the heading "FORMULA
            PLAN" is printed "The monthly retirement benefit is usally
            based on a formula involving age, years of work and final
            salary.  Sometimes called a 'defined-benefit' plan".
            Under the heading "ACCOUNT PLAN" is printed "Money is
            accumulated in an account for you until retirement.  For
            example: TIAA/CREF. 401(k) and 403(b) plans, thrift plans
            or ESOPs, defined contribution plans, salary-reduction
            plans, etc."  Under the heading "COMBINATION OF BOTH
            TYPES" is printed "Some combination plans allow employees
            to take a lump sum settlement instead of regular
            retirement benefits if they leave the employer before
            retirement age.  The most common suuch plan is the
            pre-1984 Federal pension plan or CSRS."  Printed below
            these items is "If you have both a formula and an account
            plan, please report them separately."

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working 20 or fewer hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
           these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
           [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
           if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
           occupation.

X7650      Is this income unusually high or low compared to what you

            1.  *High
            2.  *Low

           NOTE: some respondents reported that their 2000 income was
           unusually high (low), but gave a normal income figure at
           X7362 that was higher (lower).  These cases appear to be
           ones where the frame of reference for "normal" has shifted:
           e.g., a student made an unusually large amount last year as
           a student, but in a full-time job now makes more.

           The following variables relate to the structure of the
           banking markets in which the respondent lives.  These
           variables come from files maintained by the Financial
           Structure Section.  This information is matched to the
           survey data at the level of the MSA where possible, or at
           the county level otherwise.

INTERVIEWER REMARKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The data in this section were obtained in two ways.  First, some
of the data derive from the "household enumeration folder" (HEF) a
largely administrative paper document used by interviewers to select
the designated respondent, to update the area-probability sample, to
record recontact information, and to record information about
non-interviews.  Additional data were collected in the HEF on the
neighborhood in which the respondent lived and on characteristics of
the respondent.  Second, other variables (X6523, X6525, X6526, X6527,
X6528, X6529, X6530, X6531, X6532, X6533, X6534, X6535, X6536, X6724,
X6725, X6726, X6727, X6728, X6729, and X7504) were originally recorded
in "Section ZZ," a separate CAPI program used by interviewers after
the main interview to record the varibles along with other information
about the interview that might be relevant to the data editing.
Not all of the variables collected are described in this section;
only variables similar to those reported in earlier SCFs are included
here.

/ The two major types of life insurance are term and cash-value policies.  Term policies pay a benefit if the insured person dies, but otherwise have no value.  They are often provided through an employer or union, but may also be bought by individuals.  Cash-value policies also pay a death benefit, but differ in that they build up a value as premimums are paid.  Other names for types of cash value policies are "whole life" and "universal life."

/ I would like to know what general type of plan this is.  In one common type of pension or retirement plan, the monthly retirement benefit paid is based on a formula usually involving age, years of service, and salary.  In other plans, money is accumulated in an account for ^978(49/51) until ^978(40/42) retirement.    Is this plan like the formula plan or the account plan?

/ Me gustaria saber que tipo general de plan es este.  En los planes de jubilacion o pension mas comunes, el beneficio de jubilacion mensual que se paga se basa generalmente en una formula que toma en cuenta edad, anos de servicio y salario.  En otros planes, el dinero se va acumulando en una cuenta a su nombre hasta que  ^978(49/51) se jubila.  Este plan es como un plan de formula o un plan de cuenta?
/ INTERVIEWER:  IF R SAYS "CASH BALANCE PLAN," CODE "COMBINATION."  IF R SAYS "BOTH," PROBE TO BE SURE R DOES NOT REFER TO MULTIPLE PLANS.

MAPPING FROM SURVEYCRAFT VARIABLES ("Q-variables") TO SCF VARIABLES
("X-variables)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section provides a rough guide for the equivalence of SCF and
SurveyCraft variables.  The mapping is rough because duplicate
SurveyCraft variables have been collapsed into one SCF variable, and
because some information has been rearranged to conform to the
treatment of data in the SCF since 1989.  Included in this file are
the variables associated with the DKDOL subroutine, which is discussed
in the introduction to this codebook.
