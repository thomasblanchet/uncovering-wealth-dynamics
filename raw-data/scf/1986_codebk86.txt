                             INTRODUCTION
	The Federal Reserve Board has sponsored a series of Surveys of
Consumer Finances (SCF) dating back to the 1940's.  After a
several-year hiatus in the 1970s, the survey effort was renewed in
1983 and now continues, in expanded form, on a triennial basis.  The
1986 survey is the second of this new series.  The earlier surveys,
conducted annually by the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the
University of Michigan between 1946 and 1970, concentrated on
collecting information on household expectations and purchase
intentions.  Only very sketchy information was gathered on household
finances, although some data on debts and income were collected in the
later years.  Although the surveys were discontinued in 1970, in 1977
the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulatory agencies
sponsored an ad hoc survey on consumer credit usage.  Also conducted
by SRC, this survey gathered detailed data on consumer debts and
attitudes toward debt. Information was also collected on assets, 
thereby permitting the calculation of household wealth.
	In 1983 the Board decided to initiate a new series of Surveys
of Consumer Finances with an emphasis on the measurement of household
wealth.  The recognition of a number of federal agencies, particularly
the Federal Reserve and Department of Health and Human Services, that
they had a joint interest in collecting high-quality household
financial data precipitated this decision.  Joint survey sponsorship
from several agencies produced a much richer questionnaire than would
have been likely under narrower guidance.  The 1983 survey gathered
detailed data on household balance sheets, income and employment
history, expectations of retirement and future pension and Social
Security benefits, and attitudes toward and use of consumer credit.
In addition, SRC performed a linked survey of the employers of survey
respondents designed to gather detailed information on the structure
of firms' pension plans.  In order to ensure that the entire wealth
distribution was adequately sampled, the 1983 SCF supplemented its
cross-section sample with an additional sample of wealthy respondents 
drawn from tax files.
	The 1986 wave of the SCF reinterviewed 1983 survey
respondents.  While this questionnaire obtained less detailed balance
sheet data, sufficient information was collected to compute saving for
these households over 1983-86.  Employment information was also
obtained to update the work history of the panel.  In addition, the
1986 survey opened new lines of inquiry to explore the broad role of
the family in economic behavior.  Planning is now underway for a third
wave of the new SCF, scheduled to take place in 1989.
	This manual describes the set of recoded, edited, and imputed
variables developed at the Federal Reserve Board for the 1986 wave of
the SCF.  It documents the procedures used for editing the raw survey
responses, the statistical methods used for imputing missing data, the
construction of new variables from the original variables, and the
addition of new variables which have been created by matching survey
data with information from other sources.  The manual also presents
technical material on the survey's design and weights.  It should be
used in conjunction with a number of other documents, including the
comparable manual for the 1983 wave, cited below; the SRC release
titled the "1986 Survey of Consumer Finances," which describes those
variables representing the raw responses of the survey respondents;
and a comparable release from SRC for the 1983 SCF.  Additional

                  THE 1983 SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES
	The 1983 SCF was conducted through in-person household
interviews between February and August 1983.  Complete details on the
survey can be found in the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances: Technical
Manual and Codebook.  Briefly, the survey --  sponsored jointly by The
Federal Reserve Board; the Department of Health and Human Services;
the Department of the Treasury, Office of Tax Analysis; the Federal
Trade Commission; the Department of Labor; the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency; and  the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation -- was conducted by the Survey Research Center.    The
sample group was drawn from a dual frame: 5,396 households were
selected for interviewing from a standard area-probability frame and
5,000 returns of high-income taxpayers were selected by the Statistics
of Income Division (SOI) of the Internal Revenue Service.  Of the
households selected for the area-probability sample, 3,824 (71
percent) ultimately participated; this figure is somewhat lower than
expected due to a higher than expected rate of vacant dwellings.    At
first, the SOI sample members were approached indirectly.  The
Comptroller of the Currency sent introductory letters requesting
participation in the study to a sample of high-income 1980 taxpayers
selected by SOI and residing in the same sampling areas used for the
area probability sample.    Of the 459 households that subsequently
agreed to participate, 438 ultimately completed interviews.  While the
completion rate in the SOI sample is not high, it appears to be not
radically out of line with response rates to previous SOI mail surveys.
	Within each survey household, the "economically dominant"
(primary) family (or individual) was interviewed.   The same
questionnaire was used to interview respondents in both the area-
probability and high-income samples, and field interviewers were not
told which households were part of the high-income sample.  The length
of the interview averaged 74 minutes for the area- probability sample
and 87 minutes for the high-income sample.  Information was collected
(at the household level) on the following items:

Financial Assets.  The amount, type, and source of each
household checking, savings, and money market account.  Household 
holdings of publicly traded stock, bonds, certificates of deposit,
mutual funds, trusts, and notes or land contracts.  Face and cash
value of life insurance.

Tangible Assets.  The value and purchase terms of the household's principal
residence, other real estate, and automobiles.  Limited data on the value and
characteristics of businesses in which a member of the household had
both a management and equity interest. 

Pension Assets.  I.R.A., Keogh, thrift, profit sharing, 401K, and
other tax-deferred account holdings.  Estimates of the present value
and other information on each current or expected pension, including
Social Security, of the household head and spouse.

Household Debts.  The purpose, amount outstanding, source, and terms of each
household debt, including home mortgages and home equity loans, lines
of credit, credit cards, and other consumer loans.

Demographic Data.  Education, employment and marital history, age,
race, and earnings for the head and spouse of each household.  A
detailed breakdown of income by source. 

Attitudes and Financial Decision Making.  Attitudes toward saving and
credit use.  Data on the use of financial services, methods of
choosing among competing sources, and the number and proximity of the
respondent's financial institutions.

	A unique and powerful feature of the 1983 SCF is the range of
information on pensions and retirement.  In addition to data gathered
from respondents (and their spouses) about their expected dates of
retirement and their expected benefits from Social Security and
pensions, the names of their employers were also obtained.  Using this
information, the pension plans were identified, and detailed
information on the plans was drawn from the Summary Plan Descriptions
filed with the Department of Labor.  Publicly available software has
been developed to translate this complex information into more
digestible figures, such as present values of benefits and effects of
various decisions (such as early retirement) on pension benefits.
This offers the opportunity to compare respondents' perceptions of
their pension benefits and coverage with the "reality" as provided by
the firms. 

                            SURVEY DESIGN
	The 1986 SCF -- sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board, the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, and the General Accounting Office -- was a more
limited 27-minute re-interview survey with respondents to the 1983
SCF.    When 1983 couples divorced or separated, the survey followed
both parties.  However, other members who left the household, such as
young adults were not followed.  A total of 2,822 interviews were
completed, by telephone, between June and September 1986.  As in 1983,
the unit of observation was the family.
	The 1986 SCF was designed primarily to update essential
information in the 1983 SCF -- the household balance sheet and
employment data.  Sufficient information was collected that household
net worth could be estimated, although more aggregated asset and debt
categories were used (roughly 25 categories versus 85 in 1983).
Limited information was also solicited on the disposition of assets in
divorce or upon death of a spouse, purchases and sales of houses, and
major expenditures for health, durables, charity, and education.
Substantial new information was collected on gifts made or received by
the household and the recipient or source of those gifts. In a related
vein, data were gathered on the sharing of living quarters over the
three-year period.  In addition, income, marital, and employment
history over the intervening three-year period was gathered.

                        1986 SAMPLE WEIGHTS
	Because observations for the 1983 SCF were drawn from two
different sampling frames, and because the 1986 survey is a
re-interview with only a portion of the 1983 sample, construction of
appropriate sample weights is a particularly important issue.  Weights
for the 1983 survey were constructed in two phases.  Relative weights
for the area-probability sample were constructed to compensate for
differential non-response rates across the survey's 75 primary
sampling units. Those weights were further post-stratified by region
and degree of urbanization to reflect population estimates from the 
March 1983 Current Population Survey (CPS).
	Construction of weights for the full 1983 sample, including
both the area-probability and high-income sub-samples, posed a more
difficult problem.  Full information on the high-income sampling
procedure is not available, nor is the information collected from
survey respondents sufficient to construct a fully accurate measure of
the income concepts that the IRS likely used in drawing the sample.
Additional complications stem from the fact that the high-income
observations were selected from a 1980 sampling frame, but reported
data as of 1983, and the fact that the reporting basis for tax files
(individuals or married couples) is not always the same as the survey
(families). 
	These problems led to the design of 1983 sampling weights for
the high-income sample (and area-probability observations with income
above a certain level) using a post-stratification scheme based on
control totals for an "extended" income measure (roughly, equal to
IRS-defined adjusted gross income plus excluded realized capital
gains) constructed from the 1982 Tax Model File (TMF) of the IRS.
Weights were determined so that the weighted number of survey
observations for six cells with extended income above $80,000 matched
TMF control totals.  The original weights of the area-probability
observations with income below $80,000 were adjusted so that the
weighted number of SCF households equaled the population estimated
from the CPS.  High-income sample observations with income below
$80,000 were arbitrarily assigned the same weight as observations in
the $80,000 to $90,000 group.
	Construction of the 1986 sample weights proved even more
problematic.  As we argue later, there are at least two different
interpretations of the 1986 sample relevant for analysis.  Thus, at
least two different 1986 weights are necessary.  For many purposes, it
is useful to view the 1986 sample as a sub-sample of the 1983 survey.
However, it is also possible to view the 1986 sample as a new
cross-section, representative of the structure of the 1986 household
population. Accordingly, we have constructed two sampling weights for
the 1986 sample.   The first weight -- which we term the "1983/86
weight" -- was designed to allow the sample of households reached in
1986 to represent the entire 1983 sample.  The second 1986 sample
weight -- deemed the "1986 weight" -- may be used to represent the
1986 household population. 	
	As the basis for both weights, the
original 1983 weights were adjusted for attrition using a multi-stage
probability model estimated with a variety of 1983 financial,
demographic and other characteristics; the 1983 weight was multiplied
by the inverse of the estimated probability of being in the 1986
sample.  As can be seen in table 1, the 1986 sample is clearly not a
random sample from the 1983 survey.
	Each weight was further adjusted for changes in marital status
and for deviations from externally observed measures of the population
structure.  At the second stage of calculation, for the 1983/86
weight, the base weight was halved for all households that separated
or divorced; for the 1986 weight, households married since the 1983
survey received half of the base weight. Although the sample follows
separations and divorces of primary family heads and spouses, these
second-stage adjustments do not fully reflect external measures of the
structure of the population.  Finally, to compensate for this
difference, the weights were post-stratified to age, marital status
(including the sex of single respondents), and homeownership cells.
As discussed below, this adjustment was performed in either of two
ways, by using information from 1983 and 1986 independently, or by
exploiting the information in the change in the population 
structure between the two years.

*Groups are defined by their 1983 status.


	For the 1986 weight, there are two qualifications to these
post-stratification schemes. First, the 1983 SCF interviewed only
independent households.  However, because at any given time a
significant proportion of younger adults are in school or the
military, or live with their parents, those younger people living
independently at the time of the 1983 SCF are unlikely to represent
the population of households of their cohort three years later.
Therefore, the sample has not been weighted to represent the
population of households with heads aged 24 and under in 1986.
Households that fell into that group in 1986 were assigned weights
adjusted for attrition and marital status change, but were not
post-stratified to 1986 control totals.  For this reason, we strongly
recommend that only those households aged 25 or more in 1986 be used
for analysis of changes.    Second, some individuals who were heads of
households (or spouses of heads) in 1983 moved into living
arrangements where in 1986 they would no longer have been defined as a
head or spouse using SRC definitions (such as young adults moving back
to their parents' home).  In these circumstances, the
post-stratification scheme used the age, sex, and marital status of
the 1986 household member who would have been identified as the head,
instead of the characteristics of the 1983 respondent.
	What follows is a more formal description of the derivation of
the 1986 weights.  Let W83 , original weight in the 1983 survey.   Let W8386
be the weight that weights the 1986 sample to represent the 1983
population.  Let W86   be the weight that weights the 1986 sample to
represent the 1986 population.  These weights are closely related.
	Suppose for the moment that there had been no attrition from
the sample between 1983 and 1986 and that the household universe in
each year was equivalent (absent the effects of aging), but there had
been some number of divorces and new marriages.  In this case, 

	W8386 = W83 /2  if a couple has been divorced or
	      = W83 otherwise;

or summarize the relationship between W83 and W8386 by

	W8386 = W83 * phi(1) ; and

	W86 = W8386 /2 if a single person has married outside the sample,
	W86 = W8386 * 2 if a couple has been divorced, or
	W86 = W8386 otherwise;

or summarize the relationship of W8386 to W86 for each individual by

	W86 = W8386 * phi(2) .

	First we relax the assumption of no sample attrition between
1983 and 1986.    Let the inverse of the true probability of each
household's remaining in the sample be given by b.  A part of b can be
estimated using the information on the distribution of characteristics
observed in the 1983 sample, and a part, say G, is related to
unobservable characteristics.  Let this relationship be summarized as

	b = a * G

In this case, the relationships among the weights are summarized by

	W8386 = W83 * phi(1)  * a * G   and
	W86 = W8386 * phi(2)  * a * G  .

	The quantities W83, phi(1), phi(2), and a are all directly
estimable. One way to estimate the missing parameter G is to use
information available about the structure of the population in 1983
and  1986 to estimate G iteratively in the following way.
	Let the population in 1983 and in 1986 be divided into s =
1,...,n cells and let p83(s) and p86(s) be the true population counts
for cell s.  Define W8386(i), W86(i) and G(i) as the ith-round estimates of
W8386, W83 and G, respectively.  Let sigma8386(i)(s) be a scaling
factor such that
	sigma8386(i)(s)* 
             sum(over W8386 in cell s) W8386(i)= p83(s) ;

similarly, let sigma86(i) be defined by

        sigma86(i)(s)*
             sum(over W86 in cell s) W86(i)=p86(s) ;

Dropping the cell-specific notation for simplicity, the iterations are
defined as follows: 
         
        W8386(0)=W83*phi(1)*a*sigma8386(0)

        W86(0)=W8386(0)*phi(2)*a*sigma86(0)


        W8386(1)=W8386(0)*phi(1)*a*sigma8386(1)

        W86(1)=W8386(1)*phi(2)*a*sigma86(1)

        .         .
        .         .
        .         .


        W8386(T)=W8386(T)*phi(1)*a*sigma8386(T)

        W86(T)=W8386(T)*phi(2)*a*sigma86(T)


Implicitly, the final estimate of G for each case is given by

        G(T)=  {product(i=0 to T) sigma8386(i)} *
               {product(i=0 to T) sigma86(i)}

	In terms of this notation, the difference between the sets of
weights given in this codebook that use 1983 and 1986 data
independently for post-stratification (C1013, C1015 and C1016) and the
weights that use both years of data jointly (C1014, C1017 and C1018)
is that the former uses only the first round of this iterative process
while the latter is based on the 30th iteration (change is minimal
after the 10th iteration).  As discussed further below, however, this
difference can also be interpreted in terms of the comparability of
the household universes in each year.
	As we have proceeded, the estimation of the attrition
adjustment model that underlies the calculation of a is a multi-stage
process.  A set of the 1983 final area-probability sample were
excluded in 1986 when neither telephone nor address information was
obtainable; all of the original high-income sample were approached.
For the area-probability cases, a probit model is estimated for this
first-stage exclusion (that adjustment is identically unity for the
high-income cases).
	At the second stage, attrition is modeled separately for
different 1983 populations: single males, single females and married
couples.  The modeling for the single people is straightforward;
either the individuals were found or not found.  The 1983 married
couples are somewhat more complicated: if the couple remain married to
each other, they can be found or not found; if they divorce, either
can be found separately, or either or both can be not found.  For this
group, the probabilities of these events are computed using two models
sequentially:  the first model calculates the probability that both
halves of a 1983 married couple are found (still married to each
other, married to someone else, or as single people), and the second
model calculates the probability that one person was found (either
alone or married to someone else) given that both halves were not
found.  In terms of the notation above, the final estimate of a is
given by 

			  ( Pr2(found), for 1983 single males, found;
			  |
			  | Pr3(found), for 1983 single female, found;
			  |
   a = Pr1(in 1st         |
          stage sample) * { Pr4(both found), for 1983 married couples,
                   	  |   both found; or
			  |
			  | (1-Pr4(both found))*Pr5(one found), for
			  (  1983 married couples, one found.

	All of these probability models were estimated as weighted
probits using nearly the same set of independent variables drawn
entirely from the 1983 data.  These variables include:  a quadratic
spline on the age of the 1983 head of household, dummies for years of
education, indicators of income (logarithm of total family income,
dummy for capital income, logarithm of capital income, interactions of
age of the head of the household with the logarithms of total family
income and capital income), indicators of wealth (logarithm of net
wealth, dummy for home ownership, dummy for mortgage on the principal
residence, dummy for consumer debt and logarithm of consumer debt,
dummy for credit card debt, logarithm of paper assets), household
composition variables (number of people in the household, number of
children in the household, age of the youngest and oldest children,
dummy for children outside the household), an interaction term of the
age of the head of the household with the dummy for homeownership,
number of years the respondent had lived in the county of residence in
1983, a dummy reflecting whether the respondent had given "saving to
buy a house" as a reason for saving in 1983, a dummy for membership in
the high-income sample, and variables reflecting the level of interest
and suspicion that interviewers perceived in the respondents in 1983.
	The post-stratification cells were designed to reflect CPS
population characteristics while preserving differences due to
different styles of measurement in the CPS and the SCF.  For W8386,
the post-stratification cells were a cross of 1983 family type (single
female, single male, or married couple) by age class (1983 ages 22 to
41, 42 to 61, and 62 and over) by 1983 housing tenure (homeowner or
not); for W86, 1986 characteristics were used to define identical cells
except in the case of the age groups (age cells were 25 to 44, 45 to
64, and 65 and over). The 1983 control totals were derived from the
full sample of the 1983 SCF; to preserve subtle differences between
Census and SRC sampling procedures, the 1986 control totals were
calculated as the 1986 CPS cell counts less the difference between the
counts for the same cells in the 1983 CPS and the 1983 SCF.
	The post-stratification procedures followed in creating these
weights make implicit assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying
household universe.  For the versions of W8386 that reweight the sample to
align with 1983 controls independently of 1986 information (C1015 and
C1016), the assumption is simply that the adjusted 1986 sample is
still representative of the population from which it was originally
drawn.  However, the question is somewhat more complex for the 1986
weights (C1013 and C1014) and the versions of W8386 that use both 1983
and 1986 information for post-stratification (C1017 and C1018); all of
these weights implicitly assume that the 1986 household universe is
simply an aging of the 1983 universe with additions at the younger end
for newly-formed households.    While it is obvious that this
assumption is not strictly valid (e.g., there is immigration), there
is little information available to assess how significantly it
deviates from reality. 
	As one check of this difference, we have taken the population
of heads and spouses represented in the 1983 CPS, aged that population
three years with adjustments for mortality, and compared it with the
group of heads and spouses actually observed in the 1986 CPS (table
2).  As expected, the largest deviations appear at the younger end of
the age distribution where people are moving from living in
institutional arrangements (dormitories, the military, jail, etc.) to
living in households.  While this difference is particularly great
below the age 25 cut-off we have chosen in computing our weights, the
pattern is pronounced into the 30s for both sexes.  For older people,
the differences reflect movements into institutional quarters,
particularly nursing homes.  However, it is surprising that this
over-prediction begins in the 56 to 60 age group.  This may reflect
either substantial population shifts that we have not identified or
errors in the mortality factors applied.

	One final complication for W8386 is the treatment of
households that passed out of the sampled universe of households
either by moving to an institution, or by dying (these cannot be
distinguished from the data coded).  For some purposes turning on
questions of differential mortality, it may be useful to have
estimates of the 1983 population including this group of households.
For this reason, versions of W8386 including such households have been
provided (C1016 and C1018).  Note that W86 is identically zero for
these cases. 

              NON-RESPONSE AND IMPUTATIONS OF MISSING DATA
	In any household survey, some responses to survey questions
will be missing due to respondents' lack of knowledge or unwillingness
to answer.  In keeping with most comparable surveys, extensive steps
were undertaken to impute missing data for the 1983 and 1986 SCFs.
The size and complexity of the SCF made imputation difficult.  While
the sample was too small to impute missing values with "hot deck" or
matching techniques used by the Census Bureau, the comprehensiveness
of the questionnaire offered opportunities for inference not found
with shorter surveys, allowing the use of a number of different
methods for imputation. 
	For the 1983 survey, which was cleaned first, missing values
were imputed using: (1) formulas based on respondent information that
was closely related to the missing items; (2) randomized draws from
conditional frequency distributions (used primarily for discrete
variables); and (3) a variety of regression models (missing values
were assigned the regression prediction plus a random disturbance
designed to preserve the second moments of the sample).  Income and
asset regression imputations were done simultaneously, using an
iterative technique in order to preserve their full covariance
structures. 
	The area-probability and high-income samples were handled
separately.  Missing values for all observations in the high-income
sample were imputed.  In the area-probability sample, however, 159 of
the original 3824 observations in that sample were discarded because
virtually all dollar amounts for income and assets were missing.  For
the remaining observations, all missing values were imputed.
	 Similar methods were used to impute missing values for the
1986 survey.  Specific account, however, was taken of the panel nature
of the data.  Thus, regression-based imputations used 1983 values
(whether imputed or not) in the prediction equations.  These
procedures were designed to preserve the inter-temporal correlations
among the data.  Special problems were created, however, when data
were originally missing in 1983, but not 1986.  In these cases, it was
necessary to re-impute 1983 values using 1986 data.  As with the 1983
data, asset and income data were imputed simultaneously and the
area-probability and high-income samples were handled separately. 
	Several important qualifications should be made about the
relative quality of the 1983 and 1986 data.  The questionnaire for the
1983 survey was far more extensive than that for the 1986 survey; and
the 1983 survey took place in person, while the 1986 survey was
conducted by telephone.  Some information, such as the value of
principal residences and home mortgages, was solicited in similar ways
in both years.  Other data, such as financial assets, were collected
in much more aggregated form in 1986.  In making comparisons across
the two years, three areas may be particularly subject to problems of
measurement error.  First, only the size of payments on consumer
installment debts and some investment property mortgages were
collected in 1986; thus, amounts outstanding on these debts had to be
estimated using independent information on average terms.  Second, for
automobiles, only purchase data were collected in 1986; thus,
assumptions had to be made about the treatment of existing automobiles
to value the 1986 stock.  Finally, it appears that problems in the
ordering of questions in the business and employment sections of the
1986 survey caused many businesses to go unreported.  While
imputations were made in some of these instances based on 1983 data,
we suspect that aggregate 1986 businesses in the survey are still
underestimated. 
	The significance of the imputation method is illustrated by
the figures in table 3.  Column 4 shows the percentage of owners in
each of 12 asset and debt items who did not disclose the full dollar
value of their holdings in 1986.  Column 3 shows the percentage of the
sample total value for each item that was created by imputation.  As
described, business items were particularly troublesome.  Virtually
every asset category, however, had at least 10 percent of its value
imputed.  Overall, 17.4 percent of the sample wealth was imputed.

*Figures for gross assets, debts and networth are the percentage or
asset or debt owners or for net worth, the entire sample of households
aged 25 or older, who are missing any asset, debt, or wealth item. 

**This is the percentage of the aggregate weighted sample total of
each item which was imputed. 

                     COMPARABILITY WITH OTHER DATA
	Wealth information, and particularly data on changes in wealth
at the household level, are not available from many sources.  Perhaps
the finest sources of household wealth data are the Federal Reserve
Board's 1963 Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers (SFCC),
and the follow-up re-interview survey in 1964.  Methodological work
for this survey was conducted by the SRC, with interviewing performed
by the Bureau of the Census.  Like the 1983 SCF, the 1963 SFCC
collected a more detailed inventory of assets and liabilities than is
customary in other consumer surveys.  The 1963 survey also used
Federal tax information to oversample high-income households.  A
cross-section sample of housing units stratified by income reported in
the 1960 Decennial Census was chosen to represent households with
incomes below $50,000.  Households with incomes of $50,000 or more
were selected from a sample of 1960 Federal income tax returns.
Although this sample selection procedure is not exactly the same as
that used for the 1983 survey, it produced a heavy over-sampling of
households in the upper end of the income distribution, making the
1963 sample the only household survey sample comparable to the full
1983 SCF sample.
	Current data on wealth are available from the Internal Revenue
Service, which uses federal estate tax returns to estimate total
household wealth and its percentage distribution.  Unfortunately, data
from this source are available only in aggregate form, with very
limited demographic breakdowns.  Another source is the 1979 Income
Survey Development Program of the Department of Health and Human
Services, which provides information for a sample of households larger
than that of most other surveys of wealth.  The New York Stock
Exchange has also periodically conducted surveys of household
stockholders, doing a survey at roughly the same time as the 1983 SCF
and, more recently, in 1985.  Wealth data was also collected on
respondents to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) in 1984.
	The most comprehensive recent survey of household wealth was
conducted in 1984 (and repeated annually since) by the Bureau of the
Census on participants in the Survey of Income and Program
Participation (SIPP).  This survey solicited information similar to
the SCF for a very large sample of households.  Its initial panel was
a random cross-section of about 21,000 households selected by
procedures similar to those used to select the area-probability sample
for the 1983 SCF.  Net worth information was collected between
September and December 1984.    Aggregate wealth estimates from the
earlier Surveys of Consumer Finances and SIPP are generally comparable
to those from the area-probability sample of the 1983 SCF in their
understatement of aggregate wealth relative estimates from independent
sources.  Using comparably defined categories, we estimate an
aggregate net worth for the 1983 SCF area-probability sample of $8,277
billion versus a $7,740 billion total for the SIPP sample.  The
difference derives primarily from a smaller estimate of small business
assets in the SIPP.  The full-sample SCF estimate of the same net
wealth concept is $9,610 billion.  Thus, it appears that the major
difference between the two surveys arises from the inclusion of the
high-income sample in the SCF. 
	The annual March Current Population Survey is perhaps the most
comprehensive U.S. household economic survey, soliciting economic
information from approximately 59,000 households.  The
representativeness of the 1986 SCF is demonstrated by a comparison of
the sample distribution of various demographic variables for the SCF
and comparable March 1986 CPS survey in table 4.  The CPS data are
given for "primary families" defined comparably to families in the
SCF.  As can be seen, the 1986 SCF has a very similar distribution for
most items.

	The representative quality of the 1986 SCF data can also be
evaluated by a comparison with aggregate data sources.  The most
comparable of these is the Flow-of-Funds (FOF) accounts.  A comparison
of the levels of various wealth items from the 1983 SCF and FOF
accounts shows remarkable consistency, heretofore not observed with
survey data (see Avery, Elliehausen, and Kennickell (1988)).
Survey-based estimates for many asset and debt categories were within
5 to 15 percent of aggregate estimates drawn from the Flow-of-Funds
(FOF) accounts for the same time period.    Moreover, the sign of the
discrepancy was not consistent -- survey-based estimates were not
systematically higher or lower than FOF estimates.  Estimates did
differ substantially for checking and savings accounts, business, and
some real estate categories.  However, since these are areas where
there are significant problems in the FOF, it is not clear whether
discrepancies stem from measurement problems in the survey-based
estimates or from the FOF or both.
	A similar comparison can be made to see if changes in
aggregate household wealth as measured by survey data correspond to
changes as measured by the FOF.  Table 5 shows estimates of levels and
changes in levels of household wealth from FOF and the 1983 and 1986
SCFs.  The survey estimates given are weighted sums of the various
asset types using the appropriate statistical sampling weights.  For
all categories except stocks and bonds and other debt, the match of
survey and FOF growth rates are roughly in the same ranges.    The
problems with debts may stem from the methods used to estimate
outstanding amounts.  The behavior of stocks is more puzzling.  One
explanation may be that because the 1986 survey was a less detailed
survey than the 1983 survey, respondents may have been less rigorous
in recalling exact market values of shares.  In a time of rapidly
rising share prices, this may have induced substantial bias.

                         MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS
	In the remainder of the manual, information is given on all
the variables included in the final data set.  A brief description is
given for each variable along with information on imputation and a
listing of the values that the variable takes on.  The question number
corresponding to the actual 1986 survey questionnaire (e.g. H6) is
also given for all variables except recodes.  Variables are listed by
number, with the numeric code used as the basis of the variable's
internal name in the survey's SAS data set.  All variables listed here
have a "C" prefix followed by a four digit number ranging from 1001 to
1976.  The original uncleaned survey responses are contained in
variables with a "W" prefix.  These variables range from W1 to W1359.
The codes for the "W" variables are described in the original survey
codebook released by the SRC.  We note, though, that the "C" variables
contain all the same types of information as those contained in the
"W" variables, as well as additional, constructed variables.  Thus,
for most analyses, it is possible to use the "C" variables without
reference to the "W" variables.  Much of the time, the 1986 data will
be used in conjunction with data from the 1983 SCF.  The 1983
variables are denoted by "B" prefixes for the recodes and "V"
variables for the original uncleaned responses.  The 1983 variables
are described fully in the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances: Technical
Manual and Codebook. 
	The range of allowable values for the variables is also given.
The symbol xxxx is used for continuous variables with a statement of
the units used and the sample range.  For discrete variables with a
small number of allowable codes, all possible values and their
meanings are listed.  The number of sample cases (out of the 2,822
observations for the 1986 survey) taking on each value of discrete
variables is also given.  If the listing is for several variables
(such as the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd reasons for saving), then the case
totals are given for the listed variables, in order, separated by
slashes (e.g. 123/45/87 cases).  If a variable reflects 1983 data,
case totals will be for the 1986 sample, not the 1983 sample. Although
useful in giving a flavor of the distribution of responses to
questions, these case listings should not be used for statistical
purposes, as they are unweighted distributions. 
	Most of the information collected for the 1986 SCF applies to
the entire family unit.  Some information, however, such as
employment, marital history, and pension income, was collected
individually for the survey respondent and their spouse (if he or she
had one).  For married  couples, the respondent could have been either
the husband or the wife.  Unlike the 1983  datafile, the 1986 survey
file is arranged by "respondent" and "spouse."  This was done because
the 1986 respondent had to be in the 1983 survey.  Thus, there are
always 1983 variables for the  1986 respondent, but not necessarily
for the respondent's spouse (who could be a new spouse).  To
facilitate inter-year comparisons, the 1983 data have been rearranged
on the 1986 tape to 1986  respondent and the 1983 spouse of the 1986
respondent.  If another order is desired, such as 1986  "head" and
"spouse," (where head is always the husband for married couples), the
data can be  easily reordered.  Several variables, -- C1004, C1005 and
C1006 -- can be used to do this. 
	Several different codes are used in the data set, including:

	(1) The code "1" is almost always used for the answer "yes"
            to a question;  

	(2) The code "3" is generally used for the answer "sometimes"
            or "maybe"; 

	(3) The code "5" is almost always used for the answer "no" to
            a question; 

	(4) The code "-4" is used to denote a "small negative number";
	
	(5) The code "-6" is used to denote the answer "none," which
            is sometimes differentiated from zero;

	(6) The code "-7" is used to denote a special "other" response
            which does not fit into existing codes.  SRC has cards
            indicating what the actual response is.  "-7" is also
            sometimes used to denote answers like "forever" or "never"
            when used for continuous variables;

	(7) The code "-8" is used to denote the answer "don't know"
            (DK).  Most DKs have been imputed, but some still exist
            for selected variables where imputation is not appropriate 
            (e.g. attitudinal variables);

	(8) The code "-9" is used to denote "not answered" (NA).  This
            indicates either that the interviewer inadvertently did
            not ask a question or  that a respondent refused to
            answer.  Most NAs have been imputed, but a few remain; 

    	(9) The code "0" is generally used to denote cases where a
            variable is inappropriate for a particular observation
            because the question which underlies the variable was not
            asked.  For example, questions on spouses would be
            inappropriate for single households.  Note that sometimes
            a question is asked, but the answer given is none or zero
            (such as "my business is worth nothing").  These answers
            are generally coded as -6 not 0.  There are some
            instances, particularly with recoded variables, where 0
            does denote none or nothing.

	All variables on the tape are integers.  All dollar amounts
are given in whole dollars (although in answering the questions
respondents may have rounded).  Some variables had to be rescaled so
that information would not be lost (such as percentage answers which
are generally multiplied by 100).

                                       FRB Weights

	FRB staff have computed sets of weights for the 1986
respondent households that fit those households to the 1983 population
structure ("1983/86 weights") and to the 1986 population structure
("1986 weights").  These weights differ from the SRC weights.  The SRC
weights  are developed using simple proportional adjustments of the
original 1983 weights for nonresponse within the original sampling
units and adjustments for changes in the marital status.  The
construction of the FRB weights is dicussed in detail in the
introduction to this codebook; briefly, the FRB weights use a variety
of information provided by the respondent in the 1983 wave of the
survey to compute model-based attrition adjustments to the original
1983 weight, further adjustments are made for changes in marital
status of these households, and the resulting weight is
post-stratified to control totals derived from the Current Population
Survey.  Several versions of the 1983/86 and 1986 weights are
provided.  These weights differ in the way the post-stratification is
treated, and, in the case of the 1983/86 weights, in how respondents
who died or who were institutionalized are treated.  In the case of
the 1986 weights, while weights are given for households with heads
aged less than 25 in 1986, for the reasons given in the introduction,
it is strongly recommended that these cases be deleted for most analyses.

C1013	FRB 1986 WEIGHT #1
	This weight was post-stratified to 1986 CPS control totals 
        independently. This weight is zero for all cases not
        interviewed in 1986.

C1014	FRB 1986 WEIGHT #2
	This weight was computed iteratively with C1017 (or,
        equivalently, C1018) using the technique described in the
        introduction to post-stratify the weights using information on
        the population structure in both years.  This weight is
        recommended for analysis of the re-interview sample as a
        cross-section representative of the 1986 population structure.  This
        weight is zero for all cases not interviewed in 1986. 

C1015	FRB 1983/86 WEIGHT #1
	This weight was post-stratified to 1983 CPS control totals
        independently. This weight is zero for all respondents who
        died or were institutionalized since the 1983 survey.

C1016	VARIABLE DELETED

C1017	FRB 1983/86 WEIGHT #3
	This weight was computed iteratively with C1014 using the technique
        described in the introduction to post-stratify the weights using
        information on the population structure in both years.  This weight is
        zero for all respondents who died or were institutionalized
        since the 1983 survey.  This weight is recommended for
        analysis involving changes for individual families between 
        1983 and 1986.

                husband for married couples.  No missing values.

		xx. years (17 to 95)


C1115 (1986)	AGE OF SPOUSE BY DATE OF BIRTH.

C1122	1986 AGE OF HEAD--ADJUSTED.
	Some 1986 respondents moved into households in which, had the same
        criteria been applied as in 1983, they would not have been
	selected as the respondent (or spouse of a respondent).  An
        example of this would be a divorced  woman who has moved back
        to her parents' home.  The variable C1113 above restricts the
        selection of "head" to the 1986 survey respondent or their
        spouse.  C1122 indicates who would have been selected as the
        head of the 1986 household, had the 1983 criteria been
        imposed, and gives his/her age.  This variable differs from C1113 in
        27 cases.  C1122 is used in place of C1113 in constructing the
        1986 weight post-stratifications.  No missing values.

		xx. years (20 to 95)


C1123	1986 AGE OF SPOUSE--ADJUSTED.

		2. single male (280 cases)
		3. single female (619 cases)


B3111	RACE OF HOUSEHOLD.
	Variable is the observed race of the 1983 survey respondent.  This
        variable is taken from the 1983 file for all households
        surviving  into the 1986 survey.

		1. caucasian except hispanic 
		2. black except hispanic 
		3. hispanic 
		4. American Indian or Alaskan native 
		5. Asian or Pacific islander

                   arrangement is treated as a new marriage (2/0 cases) 
	question: A2


C1127	EDUCATION OF HEAD -- RECODE.
	A recode of C1630 through C1730.  The head is the respondent for single
        persons and the husband for married couples.  Most of the

C1215	1986 PSU (PRIMARY SAMPLING UNIT) NUMBER.
	An assigned number based on the observation's PSU (see B3013).
        It gives a unique sampling cell number to all observations in
        the sample.  Values 1 through 9 are the nine cells in B3012
        for the high-income observations. The remainder indicate
        area-probability sample PSUs.  Values 10 through 22 are
        self-representing PSUs.  Values 23 through 54 are PSUs located
        primarily in SMSAs and urban areas.  Values 55 through 84
        imply PSUs primarily covering rural counties.  A minus 9 (-9)
        indicates that the household had moved and in 1986 was not
        located in an SRC PSU.

C1216	1980 FRAME PSU.
	This variable indicates the number of the 1980 SRC sample PSU that the
        household lives in.  Not given for the high-income sample.
        The value in C1216 is the stratum number assigned to the PSU
        in Table A on page 87 of 1980 SRC NATIONAL SAMPLE DESIGN AND
        DEVELOPMENT, February 1986.  A minus nine (-9) indicates that

	Change in the Consumer Price Index from the 1983 respondent- interview
        month to the 1986 respondent-interview month.  If C1217 (divided by
        10,000) is multiplied by a 1983 variable (expressed in
        dollars), it will convert the variable to 1986 dollars.
        Dividing a dollar-valued 1986 variable by C1217 will convert
        it to 1983 dollars.  The mean of C1217 is 1.1125.  No missing values.

	Respondent was asked: "There seem to be two different methods
        people use to save.  Some people first put aside a certain
        amount for savings and then use the rest for expenses, while

	question: G13


C1461	NOMINAL SAVINGS 1983 TO 1986.
	This variable is computed as the household's change in wealth
        from 1983 to 1986.  For most households this is C1457 - C1458.
        If divorce split a household between 1983 and 1986 and the
        1986 respondent did not remarry, then savings is C1457 -
        C1458/2.  If a respondent, single in 1983, married before the
        1986 interview, then savings is C1457 - 2 * C1458.  For
        respondents widowed over this period, their savings were adjusted by
        their deceased spouse's bequests to non-household members (C1287 and
        C1288). Widows remarrying were assumed to marry someone
        possessing wealth equal to one-half the widow's 1983 household
        wealth.  No missing values. 

		xxxxxxxx. dollars (-32,811,444 to 35,320,915)
		       0. none (21 cases)


C1462	REAL SAVINGS 1983 TO 1986.
	This variable is the same as C1461 except that 1983 wealth is
        inflated to 1986 dollars by the change in the Consumer Price
        Index between the two interview dates (C1217).  The average
        inflation rate over the survey interval was 11.2 percent.  No
        missing values. 

		xxxxxxxx. dollars (-38,564,656 to 32,279,291)
		       0. none (19 cases)

        quarters for three months or more with adult children,
        grandchildren, or other relatives or friends during the
        previous three years.  This variable was adjusted if the 1983
        or 1986 household listings showed someone living with the
        household (even if respondent actually reported that he/she
        did not share living quarters).  No missing values.

                                     Household Income

C1301	TOTAL 1985 HOUSEHOLD INCOME.
	Total reported income.  The comparable variable for the 1983 survey is
        B3201.  Imputations for this variable were conducted in a
        number of ways. First, if respondent or spouse were missing
        current wage data, that information was imputed using the
        methods described in the employment section.  Projections of
        1985 pension and Social Security income were also made on the
        basis of information reported in 1986 and from projections of
        1983 benefits.  Alimony and child support were computed from 1986
        data, and an estimate of income from assets was made on the
        basis of reported asset data and the interest, dividend, and
        capital gain rates prevailing during 1985.  If respondents did
        not give a dollar value for their 1985 income they were probed
        for range data by the sequence: "Was your income more than
        $25,000?," then followup probes of $5,000, $10,000, $15,000,
        $20,000 or $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $75,000, $100,000 depending on
        the answer to the first probe.  About one-half of the
        respondents that did not give continuous income data responded
        fully to the probe.  In these instances, if projected income
        based on other sources fell within the bounds given by the
        respondent, the projection was used for the imputation. If the
        probe was not answered, but 1983 data indicated that the
        projected income should match income very closely, the
        projection was again used.  In all other instances, income was imputed
        from a log-linear regression with randomization.  If respondent had
        answered the probes, the imputed income was constrained to lie
        in the required interval by continuing to draw error terms
        until the imputation fell in the interval.

	question: G5,G5a


C1413 (1986)	DOLLAR CASH VALUE OF WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE.
C1414 (1983)	This is a constructed variable since life insurance questions
        	were asked in 1983, but not in 1986.  The 1986 variable was
	        imputed as described below.  First the 1983 data was used to
	        fit three functions: a linear probability model for ownership
	        of whole life insurance; a linear probability model for
	        positive cash value given life insurance; and a log-linear
        	model for the cash value assuming it had positive value.
        	These models, using predictions based on 1986 household
        	characteristics, were used to impute (with randomization) new
        	cash value for those households without life insurance (or
        	cash value) in 1983 or those with new spouses.  Allocation
        	rules for those households which possessed life insurance in
        	1983 and lost a spouse (widows and divorces) between 1983 and
         	1986 were also based on the prediction function.  For the
        	remainder of 1983 households with life insurance, the
        	predicted change in their value, based on the change in their
         	characteristics from 1983 to 1986, was used.  The overall
        	totals were slightly adjusted so that the growth in sample
        	holdings of life insurance matched the Flow-of-Funds account
        	estimates of the growth in life insurance reserves between
        	1983 and 1986.  C1414 is equal to B3475.

                equal to B3477 + B3601 + B3470.  All missing values

         	missing values were imputed.  The imputation was done by
        	extrapolation from the purchase price or first mortgage value,
        	or by regression for log-value with a random term added.  The
        	extrapolation was based on the purchase price and date and

C1419 (1986)	BUSINESS ASSETS.
C1420 (1983)	Household net holdings of privately-held businesses, farms,
               	professional practices or partnerships.  This is the net
         	market value of the household's interest.  Discretion should
         	be taken in working with the 1986 business value.  In
         	answering all asset questions, respondent was asked to report
         	assets "he/she had not already mentioned." Unfortunately this
         	created problems for some self-employed respondents who had
         	reported their job details earlier in the interview.  Some of
         	these respondents assumed that he/she had "already mentioned"
         	the business associated with the job and did not report it in
         	the asset section.  Extensive efforts were taken to look for
         	margin notes and other indications of a business.  It was
         	assumed that respondents who worked at the same self-employed
         	job in 1983 and 1986 and who owned the business in 1983,
         	still controlled the business.  After these corrections were
         	made for the presence of a business, the imputation of the 1986
         	business value was done by the same method as for businesses
         	whose ownership was acknowledged in 1986 without giving a
         	specific value.  These imputations were made using log-linear
         	regressions with random terms added.  Despite these 
                corrections, this variable is among the least reliable
                of the 1986 numbers. C1420 is equal to B3501 + B3502.

	question: G9,G9a


C1421 (1986)	GROSS MARKET VALUE OF VEHICLES.
C1422 (1983)	This is a constructed variable for 1986 since only questions
         	about the total price of vehicles purchased, not about current
         	auto value, were asked.  The automobile value was imputed as
         	follows.  First, the 1986 value of each household's 1983
         	vehicles was estimated from the July 1986 National
         	Association of Automobile Dealers (NADA) "blue book" value
          	(the make and model year of each vehicle was collected in
          	1983).  Second, the 1983 data was used to fit linear
          	probability models to predict the number of automobiles
          	households would own.  These functions were used to predict
          	changes in the number of automobiles for those households
          	going through marital change, with changes assigned randomly
          	based on the function.  Third, external pricing data and a
          	model based upon the value of automobiles owned, was used to
         	estimate the number of vehicles purchased (households
         	reported only the total amount spent on vehicle purchases
         	between 1983 and 1986).  Fourth, the timing of new vehicle
         	purchases was estimated by drawing randomly from the
         	distribution of aggregate car and truck sales in each
         	price range.  This distribution was adjusted if the household
         	had bought a car just prior to the 1983 interview.  Purchase
         	timing was estimated jointly with the timing of auto loans (if
         	any), with constraints imposed on allowable loan-to-value
         	ratios based on the prevailing loan terms for each time
         	period.  These four pieces of information were used to
         	determine the vehicle value in 1986.  If a household was
         	assumed to still possess an automobile owned in 1983, that
         	vehicle's 1986 NADA value was used.  Purchase values (divided
         	into individual vehicles based on the estimated number of
         	purchases) were depreciated to 1986 values using NADA
         	depreciation schedules for cars of that price range and the
         	estimated timing of purchase.  Households likely to be adding
         	cars (though new marriages) were assigned value estimates for
         	these cars based on the 1983 predictive model.  C1422 is equal
	        to B3902.

C1423 (1986)	AGGREGATE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING ON OTHER
C1424 (1983)	PROPERTY MORTGAGES.
         	Respondents reported the amount outstanding on mortgages
         	against 1986 properties other than their primary residence
         	only for mortgages without regular payments.  Otherwise,
         	respondents only reported the payment size and frequency. The
         	amount outstanding was estimated from the payment size in the
         	following way.  In many instances, the property value and
         	payment size could be used to infer that the property was also
         	owned in 1983.  The outstanding value of the mortgage could
         	then be easily computed from the loan terms reported in 1983
         	(when more detail was given).  If it was deemed to be a new
         	property (or addition) then the timing of the mortgage was
         	drawn randomly over the three-year interval from 1983 to 1986,
         	and maturity and interest rates assigned based on prevailing
         	rates at that time.  The timing draw was constrained by
         	allowable loan-to-value ratios.  The imputed interest rate,
         	time of loan, and maturity was then sufficient to impute an
         	amount outstanding at the time of the 1986 survey.  C1424 is
         	equal to B3802 + B3602.

C1434 (1986,B)	This is a constructed variable, as respondents were only

C1440 (1986,D)	1986 loans.  Imputations were made in the same way as
         	described above for the outstanding balances on other
         	property mortgages.  Balances for loans deemed to be still
         	outstanding from 1983 were determined from the 1983 data.
         	The timing of new loans was imputed randomly, and terms of the
         	loan inferred from prevailing terms for loans of that
         	type at that time.  These imputations were subject to
         	loan-to-value constraints on auto and home improvement
         	loans imposed by reported purchase amounts.  Auto loan
         	timing was done simultaneously with the imputation of
         	vehicle values.  Given the terms and timing of
	        the loans, the amount outstanding could be derived easily.

C1443 (1986)	TOTAL NON-REGULAR PAYMENT DEBT
C1444 (1983)	OUTSTANDING.
	        The total amount outstanding of non-installment
                consumer debt.  This variable excludes mortgages
                mentioned previously.  In 1986, respondents were asked
                for separate category totals. Prompts were given for
                life insurance loans, debts to some other person,
                banks, employer, margin account, or loans used to
                purchase their home (other than mortgages).  Life
                insurance loans were asked for, but are purged in net
                worth calculations.  Thus, some efforts were made to
                remove such loans from the 1986 number (if they could
                be identified). Imputations were made from outstanding
                1983 loans, and in some instances from log-linear
                regressions with random terms added. C1444 is equal to
                B4203 + B4125.  B4125 is loans against open- ended
                lines of credit.  Uncertainty whether 1986 respondents
                would term these "regular payment" loans or not (or
                even if they would report them) causes problems in
                identifying such loans.  This is thought to be the
                most likely match.

C1461	NOMINAL SAVINGS 1983 TO 1986.
	This variable is computed as the household's change in wealth
	from 1983 to 1986.  For most households this is C1457 - C1458.
	If divorce split a household between 1983 and 1986 and the
	1986 respondent did not remarry, then savings is C1457 -
	C1458/2.  If a respondent, single in 1983, married before the
	1986 interview, then savings is C1457 - 2 * C1458.  For
	respondents widowed over this period, their savings were
	adjusted by their deceased spouse's bequests to non-household
	members (C1287 and C1288).  Widows remarrying were assumed to
	marry someone possessing wealth equal to one-half the widow's
	1983 household wealth.  No missing values.

		        (A) First mortgage loan
		        (B) Second mortgage loan

     If the household owns its residence (or is currently buying), data are
given for up to two mortgages (or land contracts) against the property.  The
"first" mortgage is self-defined by the respondent and may not be a legal
first mortgage.  Land contracts will be listed as first mortgages.  Second
mortgages are also self-defined.  If respondent purchased the home or
refinanced the mortgage(s) since 1983, then he/she gave loan details as part
of the 1986 survey.  If it was an older mortgage then the respondent gave only
the payments, and other details of the loan had to be taken from the 1983
survey.  Variables B4001-B4038 give 1983 information corresponding to this
section.


C1525 (1986)	HOUSE MORTGAGE TOTAL.

		2. mortgage listed as second mortgage in 1983 (1/37 cases)
		3. mortgage listed as other housing loan (first) in 
                   1983 (5/2 cases)

C1528 (A)	AMOUNT OUTSTANDING ON MORTGAGE.
C1543 (B)	The variable is directly answered if the mortgage does not
          	have regular payments.  Otherwise it is calculated based on
        	the date the mortgage was taken out, the payment frequency,
	        the number of original payments, the payment size (PAYMENT),
        	balloon size (BALLOON), and the interest rate (INTEREST).  For
        	a monthly payment mortgage, for example, the formula would be:
        	VALUE=PAYMENT*((1-1/(1+INTEREST/12)**PAYLEFT) /
        	(INTEREST/12)) + BALLOON/((1+INTEREST)**PAYLEFT),
        	where PAYLEFT is the number of payments left.  No missing
        	values.

        	If the mortgage has regular payments and all payment terms

        	terms were missing, the average conventional mortgage rate, as
        	reported in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for the date of the
        	mortgage (month and year), was assigned.  Yearly averages for

                         (R) 1986 Survey Respondent
			 (S) Spouse

     Demographic data are given for the household respondent and spouse (if
married).  The 1983/1986 tape is sorted by "respondent" and "spouse" rather
than "head" and "spouse" which was used for the 1983 data (following past
convention, the head is arbitrarily assigned to the husband for married
couples).  Couples "living together" or in common-law marriage are counted as
married.  Most data is given only for spouses living in the household.
However, marital history information is given for separated spouses as well.

                same as C1140 and C1704 is the same as C1143 (if
                married).  All missing values were imputed.

                             CURRENT JOB

                     (R) 1986 Household respondent
                     (S) Spouse

     Information is given for the current job if the respondent or
spouse is working or temporarily laid off from his/her job.  Detailed
job data (other than wages and pension information) was asked only of
those respondents (and spouses) who were working at a different job
than in 1983.  In a surprising number of cases, the respondent's 1986
statement of his/her 1983 working status was inconsistent with the
answer he/she gave in 1983.  This necessitated a fairly substantial
number of imputations of job data for people who, in 1986, said they
working the same job as in 1983, but had not been recorded as working
at that earlier date.

                imputed by matching the March 1986 CPS average
                log-wages for persons of same sex, race, age, and
                three-digit occupation and then adding a random error
                term.  Imputations were done on a per-hour wage basis
                and adjusted for hours-per-week and weeks-per-year.
                For the high-income sample, imputations were made
                using occupation/age tables constructed from those
                high-income observations with relatively complete
                data.  After matching, random terms were added during
                imputation.

               Calculated Relative Real Wage Growth Variables

     Using the March 1986 CPS survey data, log-wage (annual income)
was regressed against a constant, age, max(0,age-35), max(0,age-55),
dummies for level of education (high school graduate, some college,
college graduate, and post baccalaureate study -- less than high
school graduate is the omitted category), and dummies for non-white,
self-employment, and less than 20 hours per week of work.  Separate
regressions were run for males and females.  The regressions were also
run separately for each 1980 three-digit occupation code.  This yields
within-occupation expected annual real wage growth rates (abstracting
from economy-wide productivity growth) for three different age spans,
controlling for race and sex.  Predicted values from the regression
also yield the average full-time annual income by three-digit
occupation code controlling for age, sex, and race.
