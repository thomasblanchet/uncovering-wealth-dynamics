Subject:  Description of the processed version of the 1998 SCF

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: This codebook contains over 78,000 lines of text, including
this introduction, variable descriptions, the program used to collect
the survey data, and other material.  Most users will probably NOT
want to print the entire document.  Generally, we work with the file
in electronic form.

This codebook serves as the principal guide to the variables
included on the final public version (February 1, 2000 version) of the
1998 SCF dataset.  However, not every variable included in this
codebook is actually in the public use dataset.  Among other things,
the dataset does NOT include most variables related to the sample
design, details of geography, or the 3-digit industry and occupation
codes.  Although we have attempted to mark the variables in the
codebook that are not available to the public, there may be errors or
omissions.  The definitive list of the variables included is given at
the end of this file.  Please consult that list to determine whether a
given variable is available to you.

For a general overview of the 1998 SCF, see Arthur B. Kennickell,
Martha Starr-McCluer, and Brian J. Surette "Recent Changes in
U.S. Family Finances: Results from the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances,"
Federal Reserve Bulletin, January 2000, pp. 1-29.  Results you may
obtain from using this release of the 1998 SCF may differ from those
reported in this article for several reasons.  First, the analysis
weights used in that article were altered to provide robust estimates
of the detailed categories shown.  In brief, the data were examined for
extreme outliers, and where a given case was overly influential in
determining an outcome, the weight was trimmed and other weights were
inflated to maintain a constant population.  In some other cases, a
broad view of the data in the analytical framework of the article
necessitated the assignment of some data to different categories than
those implied by a narrower and more straightforward interpretation of
the data.  Second, as noted below, the public version of the data has
been systematically altered to minimize the likelihood that unusual
individual cases could be identified.  Our analysis of the public
dataset suggests that these changes should not alter the conclusions
of reasonable analyses of the data.  Finally, over time we correct
errors that we find in the dataset.  In our past experience, the
effect of these errors on the estimates has been quite small.

The primary data files for the survey consist of the following pieces:
the main dataset and a file of replicate weights corresponding to
X42001 (see below for a description of the replicate weights).  In 
addition, an aggregated version of the main dataset containing summary 
variables corresponding to those used in "Recent Changes in
U.S. Family Finances: Results from the 1998 Survey of Consume Finances" 
(Arthur B. Kennickell, Martha Starr-McCluer, and Brian J. Surette, 
Federal Reserve Bulletin, Janary 2000, v. 86, pp. 1-29) is available 
in a format compatible with most spreadsheet software.  To aid users
in reconciling their calculations with those found in the January 2000 
Bulletin Article, two sets of tables are provided: the first set is
based on the current internal version of the data, and the second
version is based on the current public version of the data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTIONNAIRE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1998 SCF was collected using computer-assisted personal
interviewing (CAPI).  Thus, there is no questionnaire in the usual
sense.  This codebook serves as the most comprehensive guide to the
definitions of variables included in the survey.  At the end of this
file, a copy of the Surveycraft (SC) program that was used to collect the
data is included.  The SC program serves as the authoritative
reference for questions relating to question ordering and skip
sequences.  Because question ordering is important in understanding
the meaning of many questions, users of the data are encouraged to
consult the SC program.  At the very end of this file, a translation
of most SC variables into SCF variables is provided.  Although there
is usually a direct correspondence between the SC variables and the
final variables listed in this codebook, there are some places where
the connections are indirect: In some cases, the same question is
asked in two difference places, and in the final dataset all instances
of answers to the question are mapped into a single location; in other
cases variables may be inferred from other information (for example,
if a respondent reported a wage on a current job and reported that
their employer contributed a certain percent of their wage to a
pension plan, then the dollar contribution to the plan would be filled
in).  Almost always, the data rearrangements can be identified from
the shadow variables associated with the variables (see section
"VARIABLE NAMES" below).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNIT OF ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the data in the survey are intended to represent the financial
characteristics of a subset of the household unit referred to as the
"primary economic unit" (PEU).  In brief, the PEU consists of an
economically dominant single individual or couple (married or living
as partners) in a household and all other individuals in the household
who are financially dependent on that individual or couple.  For
example, in the case of a household composed of a married couple who
own their home, a minor child, a dependent adult child, and a
financially independent parent of one of the members of the couple,
the PEU would be the couple and the two children.  Summary information
is collected at the end of the interview for all household members who
are not included in the PEU.  The only variables collected separately
for the respondent and the spouse or partner of the respondent are
those concerning employment, pension, and demographic characteristics.
Throughout the codebook, we refer to the "head" of the household.  The
use of this term is euphemistic and merely reflects the systematic way
in which the dataset has been organized.  The head is taken to be the
single core individual in a PEU without a core couple.  In a PEU with
a central couple, the head is taken to be either the male in a
mixed-sex couple or the older individual in the case of a same-sex
couple.  No judgment about the internal organization of the households
is implied by this organization of the data.  When the original
respondent was someone other than the person determined to be the head
in this sense, all data (including response codes) for the two members
of the couple were systematically swapped. The variable X8000
indicates which cases have been subjected to such rearrangement.

NOTE: Because only limited information is collected on the
ownership of assets and liabilities within the PEU, it is not
possible, in general, to make direct separate estimates of the
financial characteristics of the individuals in the survey
households unless one is prepared to make a number of fairly complex
assumptions.  To understand this point more thoroughly, there is no
substitute for a careful reading of the actual survey questions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLE DESIGN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SCF is based on a dual-frame sample design (see "Consistent Weight
Design for the 1989, 1992, and 1995 SCF, and the Distribution of
Wealth," Arthur B. Kennickell and R. Louise Woodburn, June 1997,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html for more
details).  One set of the survey cases was selected from a standard
multi-stage area-probability design.  This part of the sample, which
contributed 2,813 cases to the final set of interviews, is intended to
provide good coverage of characteristics, such as home ownership, that
are broadly distributed in the population.  The other set of the
survey cases was selected as a list sample from statistical records
(the Individual Tax File) derived from tax data by the Statistics of
Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service (SOI).  These records
were made available under strict rules governing confidentiality, the
rights of potential respondents to refuse participation in the survey,
and the types of information that can be made available.  This second
sample was designed to disproportionately select families that were
likely to be relatively wealthy (see "List Sample Design for
the 1998 SCF," Arthur B. Kennickell, April 1998,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html for a more 
extended discussion of the design of the list sample).  The list
sample contributed 1,496 cases to the final set of interviews.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For many purposes it is useful to know which responses were available
to the interviewer and which were actually known by the respondent.
Responses that are noted in the codeframes below by an asterisk are
ones that were available to the interviewer on the screen.  In some
cases, codes were only available given a response to an earlier
question.  One example that appears throughout the interview is the
reporting of institutions where the respondent has an account of some
type.  If the respondent reported fewer than six financial institution
at X305, every time the interviewer came to a question that asked
about the institution where the respondent had an account, the screen
displayed the names of the already listed institutions (referred to as
"Institution 1" etc. in the codebook), a code for "add an
institution," and a code to enter to record an unusual type of
institution ("other").  Once six institutions had been recorded
(either at X305 or by adding institutions later in the interview), the
screen displayed the names of the six institutions, the "other" field,
and a set of codes for the type of institution (i.e., commercial bank,
savings and loan or savings bank, credit union, etc.).

In general, if a response is given in the codebook in lower case
letters, this indicates that it could have been read to the
respondent.  Responses listed in all upper case letters are ones that
were not intended to be read to the respondent.  Codes that result
from the recoding of responses originally reported as "other" are
given in lower case letters.  Codes that could have appeared on the
computer screen are marked with an asterisk.  Question texts given in
capital letters are intended as interviewer instructions.

For many questions there are multiple versions.  Most commonly, there
are variants that are appropriate for single individuals and ones
appropriate for families of two or more.  Some other variants are more
complicated.  For example, suppose that a respondent lives in a
building with multiple housing units (X702=1), the family owns the
entire building (X714=1), and they own the unit they live in
separately from the rest of the building.  The CAPI program stores the
information that there is such a property.  Later in the interview
when the respondent is asked about the number of investment real
estate and vacation properties, one variant of question X1701 reminds
the respondent to include the property mentioned earlier.  There are
many other such instances where the computer alters questions to
suit the previous answers given by the respondent, and this codebook
attempts to provide at least a summary form of all the possible
questions.  For example, at X1711 (correspondingly at X1811 and
X1911), the respondent is asked whether there are any outstanding
loans on a property.  If the respondent had previously reported at
X1703 (correspondingly at X1803 and X1903) that the property was a
time-share, then the variant for time-shares is asked; otherwise a
more generic question is asked.

The authoritative references for deterimining how the information was
presented to the respondent are the executable CAPI program, which is
available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/98/scf98home.html,
and the text of the CAPI program appended to this codebook.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLE NAMES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This codebook refers to the variables by the names they have in the
version of the survey dataset formatted for use with SAS.  These names
consist of a number prefixed by an "X."  We have tried, insofar as it
was possible, to retain the variable numbering system used in earlier
SCFs.  Where the content of a variable has changed in a substantive
way, we have assigned a new variable number.  Since the 1995 SCF, a
small number of questions were added, and a small number were deleted.

Each of the variables in the main dataset has a "shadow" variable that
describes--in almost all cases--the original state of the variable
(i.e., whether it was missing for some reason, a range response was
given, etc.).  An exception is reported values which have been
imputed or otherwise altered to protect the privacy of respondents
(see "DISCLOSURE REVIEW" below).  Users who so desire may use the shadow
variables to restore the data to something very close to their
original condition. The shadow variables have the same numbers as the
main variable, but have a prefix of "J."  A list of the values taken
by the shadow variables is given in the section below entitled
"DISCUSSION OF RANGE DATA COLLECTION AND J-CODES."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL DATA CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the SCF dataset, a value of zero has only one meaning: that
the item in question in inapplicable.  That is, if a family does not
have a checking account, then the number of checking accounts they own
would be coded as a zero.  Whenever zero is a legitimate response to a
question, a value of -1 is used to signify that value.  Other
specialized codes are defined for each variable in the codebook.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE ID NUMBERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the original numbering system (XX1), important aspects of the
sample design are apparent from the identification numbers.  Because
such information is not releasable under the agreements which allow us
to collect the data, each case included in the public version of the
dataset has been given a random identification number (YY1).  Users
should note that it is not possible to know with certainty from the
information provided in the public version of this dataset which cases
derive from the list sample.  Because we routinely use the original
numbers internally, users who direct questions to us about specific
cases might want to be sure to emphasize that they are using the
external ID number to avoid confusion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"OTHER" CODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In almost every case where a respondent could supply a response that
did not fit in the codeframe offered to interviewers on their computer
screens, the CAPI program was constructed to allow the entry of a
verbatim response.  There were a few open-ended questions that were
set up to accept only a verbatim response.  All of these responses were
run through a standard coding process at NORC.  Once the data were at
the FRB, strenuous efforts were made to resolve all instances of
responses that were unresolved by the NORC coders.  Responses that
remain coded "other" in the final dataset are unusual, but legitimate
responses which do not fit within the existing codeframe; because
these responses appear unlikey to reoccur in future surveys, the
codeframe was not augmented.  Responses that were not informative (or
were not answers to the questions that were asked) were treated as
missing values and were imputed.  An identical process was followed
for the 1995 SCF.  In earlier surveys, the information recorded for
"other" responses was not as complete, and the efforts to recode the
available verbatim data were somewhat less stringent.  Thus, analysts
should exercise caution in time series comparisons of "other"
responses from the 1995 and 1998 surveys with those in earlier years.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRIDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some sets of questions have a natural iterative pattern.  For example,
the survey asks for detailed information on up to the first six
checking accounts owned by the PEU, and summary information is
collected about all remaining accounts.  The detailed questions are
the same for each account.  In past interviews done with paper and
pencil, some respondents have resisted answering all the detailed
questions and have been willing to provide only summary information.
Typically, interviewers recorded the summary information in the
margins of the questionniare, and editors allocated the data to the
skipped questions according to a set of fixed rules.  To allow for
a variety of respondent-interviewer interactions in the SCF CAPI
program, the grid questions were organized to provide a way of
collecting summary information in a systematic way.  We refer to the
associated summary variables as "mop-up variables."  Past surveys also
indicated that some respondents recalled additional instances of
items once they began answering questions in a grid, but interviewers
often did not revise the originally reported number.  The CAPI
procedures were set up to allow for this possibility as well.

Consider first a respondent who gives a non-missing response to the
question that asks for the number of items of the type to be queried
in the grid.  The interviewer would ask the respondent the first set
of detailed questions on the item.  Then, the interviewer would be
confronted with a question (not to be read to the respondent);

  INTERVIEWER:  CAN R PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT ANOTHER xxxx?

The intention of this question was to allow the interviewer to deal
with a potentially hostile respondent and immediately branch to the
mop-up questions.  If the respondent was cooperative, the interviewer
entered a YES response and continued through an identical procedure for
each iteration until either the number of items reported was
exhausted, or the maximum number of detailed questions was asked and
the mop-up question was asked to get summary information on all
remaining items.  If the respondent reported a number of items less
than the maximum number about which the detailed questions are asked,
the following question was asked at the end of the final iteration:

  Do you (or your family living here) have another xxxx?

A YES response here indicates that the respondent recalled an
additional instance in the process of answering the detailed
questions.  A respondent could continue to "add" iterations until the
maximum number of iterations is reached and the mop-up questions are
asked.

Another possibility is that a respondent may either not know (or be
unwilling to tell) the number of instances of an item.  Because it is
known that there is at least one such instance, the first set of
detailed questions is asked.  Then the respondent is asked:

  Do you (or your family living here) have another xxxx?

The questioning then proceedes exactly as it would for a respondent
who recalled additional instances after providing an initial number of
instances.

In processing the data, several steps were taken to attribute the data
collected to their correct location.  First, in some cases interviewers
answered the question "INTERVIEWER:  CAN R PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT
ANOTHER xxxx?" negatively, even though only one more instance
remained.  In such cases, the mop-up data were mapped into the
appropriate position in the grid.  This data movement is not directly
recorded in the J-variables for such cases, although the movement can
be deduced from the patterns of J-variables of other questions within
the iteration of the grid that do not have mop-up equivalents: the
value of the J-variables for such variables without mop-up equivalents
would normally be 2052.  Second, when respondents added instances, the
originally reported number was updated and stored in the customary SCF
variable number.  The originally reported number of instances has been
retained in the dataset since such information cannot be recovered in
any other way from the data made available.  Third, when summary
information was given by respondents who broke off their responses in
a grid prematurely, that information was used to bound the imputations
of the detailed data.  Data items that have an associated J-variable
with a value of 90 are ones where a complete response was given in the
parallel mop-up variable, and those with a J-variable of 91 are ones
where a range response was given in the parallel mop-up variable.
There are some complicated mixed cases where a respondent gave
a missing value for the number of instances, but was willing to
provide non-missing mop-up data.  Though tedious, it is possible to
deduce this information from the J-variables provided.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY VARIABLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have not included summary variables (e.g., NET WORTH) in the main
data set.  Although it is complicated to construct such variables, it
is our belief that a substantial amount of judgment is involved in
defining variables, and that other analysts should make their own
decisions.  However, as a guide to users, we have included on the SCF
web site a program written in the SAS language that was used to
create the variables used in the January 2000 Federal Reserve Bulletin
article on the survey.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A very large amount of time has been spent in searching for errors in
the data and resolving those errors.  Many seeming inconsistencies are
actually in the raw data and appear to have no obvious reconciliation.
Our presumption is always that the respondent understood each question
and reported accurately, and that the process of transcription and
coding did not distort that information.  In the relatively small
number of cases where other information led us beyond a reasonable
doubt of the validity of the data, we have changed data, either by
altering values directly or by setting them to missing and imputing
them; in all such cases, the shadow variables indicate that we have
overridden reported data (for an overview of the extent of data
changes, see "Measuring Data Quality In the 1998 Survey of Consumer
Finances," Arthur B. Kennickell, August 1999,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  We ask our
colleagues who use this dataset to help us in finding any remaining
resolvable inconsistencies.

The imputations are subject to the hierarchical logical constraints,
but otherwise they reflect the fundamental inconsistencies in the
other data.  For example, total income (X5729) in the reported data is
often not equal to the sum of the individual components (X5702 etc.),
so this constraint is not applied to the imputed data.  Variability in
the imputations for a variable in a given case, sometimes may be
large.  This variation is a reflection of the fundamental uncertainty
about the value of the item.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPUTATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the variables that originally contained a missing value code
have been imputed.  The exceptions include such variables as X6695
(which reports the original number of checking accounts reported by
the survey respondent) and X6504 (which is the interviewer's
description of the property where the respondent lives).  The nature
of any missing values may be understood by examining the J-codes
associated with the variables.  The overwhelming majority of variables
that originally contained missing values have been imputed five times
by drawing repeatedly from an estimate of the conditional distribution
of the data.

These imputations are stored as five successive replicates
("implicates") of each data record.  Thus, the number of observations
in the full dataset (21,545) is five times the actual number of
respondents (4,309) (see DISCLOSURE REVIEW below for information on
the public version of the dataset).  The imputation procedure is
described in "Multiple Imputation in the Survey of Consumer Finances"
(Arthur B. Kennickell, September 1998,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  For a
general discussion of multiple imputation and its uses, see MULTIPLE
IMPUTATION FOR NONRESPONSE IN SURVEYS by Donald B. Rubin, John Wiley
and Sons, 1987.  Multiple imputation offers two distinct advantges
compared with singly-imputed data.  First, because multiple imputation
yields multiple outcomes from a random process, it supports more
efficient estimation than singly-imputed data.  Second, multiple
imputation allows users to make straightforward estimates of the
degree of uncertainty associated with the missing information.

For users who want to estimate only simple statistics such as means
and medians ignoring the effects of imputation error on the standard
errors of these estimates, it will probably be sufficient to divide
the weights by 5.  Software to compute means and medians and their
associated standard errors with respect to imputation and sampling
error is provided in the section on sampling error later in this
codebook.

Users who want to estimate more complex statistics, particularly
regressions, should be cautious in their treatment of the implicates.
Many regression packages will treat each of the five implicates as an
independent observation and correspondingly inflate the reported
significance of results.  Users who want to calculate regression
estimates, but who have no immediate use for proper significance
tests, could either average the dependent and independent values
across the implicates or multiply their standard errors by the square
root of five.  For an easily understandable discussion of multiple
imputation in the SCF from a user's point of view, see Catherine
Montalto and Jaimie Sung, "Multiple Imputation in the 1992 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 7, 1996,
pages 133-146 (or on the Internet at 
http://hec.osu.edu/people/shanna/imput.htm).  That article also
contains a set of simple SAS macros to use to compute correct standard
errors from multiply imputed data.  An alternative that is useful for
handling the output of general modeling routines is the following set
of SAS code:

*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;

******************************************************************************;

******************************************************************************;

* MACRO MISECOMP computes standard errors corrected for multiple imputation;
* The input may be regression results, or any other results (e.g.,
  probits) that include a point estimate and a standard error estimate
  for each implicate;
* The datasets are named &DSN.1-&DSN&NIMP (where &DSN and &NIMP are
  defined below);
* The form of the input dataset is described above;
* Often, it is quite easy to copy output directly from a statistical
  procedure into the form of this program without deleting extraneous
  information;
* The required input variables are VARN (a name of the statistic of
  interest in all NIMP datasets), B1-B&NIMP (a working name for the
  point estimate of interest for each implicate--where the terminal
  number corresponds to the terminal number of the input dataset), and
  S1-S&NIMP (a working name for the standard error of the point
  estimate in each implicate--where the terminal number corresponds to
  the terminal number of the input dataset;
* The parameters of the MACRO are:
  NIMP: number of implicates (default is 5)
  DSN: first part of name of each of the NIMP input datasets (e.g.,
  DSN11, DSN12,...,DSN15 could be results for implicates 1-5 for model
  1) (default is DSN1i, where "i" ranges from 1 to NIMP)
  PRNTPR: determines the number of digits of the output data (default
  is SAS format 10.6);
* The output includes three lines for each unique VARN in the
  input datasets: the final point estimate, the final standard error,
  and the final t-statistic;

******************************************************************************;

* Steps to compute standard errors;
* (1) run each model (regressions, probits, etc.) for each of the five
  implicates separately;
* (2) copy the model outputs into program code as described above;
/*
  For example,
  DATA DSNij;
    INPUT VARN $ Bi Si;
    CARDS;
    data here
    ;
  RUN;
  where "i" ranges over the number of distinct models treated, and "j"
  ranges over the number of implicates.
  NOTE: any technique that reads VARN, Bi and Si into the datasets will
  work.

DISCUSSION OF RANGE DATA COLLECTION AND J-CODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the 1995 SCF, the CAPI program has allowed interviewers a
variety of ways to enter partial information (for a detailed
description and analysis of range data in the 1995 survey, see "Using
Range Techniques with CAPI in the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances,"
Arthur B. Kennickell, January 1997,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  In the
past, we had evidence that some respondents volunteered figures in
ranges.  Good interviewers have always tried to get respondents to
settle on a single "best" figure, but sometimes it may be that there
is no firm figure (e.g., the value of a privately-held business
may be known only at the point it is actually sold) and probing too
far could cause the respondent to answer "don't know" or to refuse to
answer.  The CAPI program allows for responses to be reported in
ranges volunteered by respondents.  There is another class of
respondents who may not volunteer a range, who do not know (or will
not give) an exact figure, but who will give some information about
the value.  To obtain information from this second group of people,
the CAPI program includes two options. First, a respondent who is
uncomfortable actually saying an amount may report a letter from a
card that specifies a number of ranges.  The range card has been used
very successfully in earlier waves of the SCF, but CAPI allows the
option to be presented consistently.  Second, a respondent who
declines the use of the range card is asked a series of questions in a
"decision tree" that are designed to specify a range.  The dollar
breaks in the decision trees vary by question (so that, for example,
monthly rent is not subject to the same ranges as the value of
corporate stock).  The computer sequences used for range followup for
all dollar values in the survey (known as "DKDOL") are outlined
schematically in a section below.  It should be noted that
interviewers were strongly instructed that a single dollar value is
the best answer to each of these questions.  Although there is the
distinct possibility that respondents may become "trained" in the use
of the range questions during the course of the interview (the effect
of this training is unclear at present: respondents may tend to report
"too many" ranges because they know that they are allowed;
alternatively, respondents may learn that it is much quicker to give a
single dollar figure), interviewers should be using all of the
standard techniques to get respondents to give a single figure where
possible.  Evidence from the 1995 SCF suggests that this approach
dramatically reduces the frequency of "don't know" responses, but it
has little effect on refusals.  Although the overall proportion of
respondents reporting no information is much lower, generally the
proportion providing complete response declined.

level 2:  Confirm    Range card                    Range card?
                     or dollar range?

level 5:                     OUT                      OUT


(OUT=proceed to next question)

At the first level, the respondent has the option of providing a
dollar amount (as in the past, interviewers were strongly urged to
obtain a single dollar value where possible), volunteering a range,
answering "don't know," or refusing to answer.  Each of these
responses implies a different sequence of questions.  In the case of a
single dollar figure, the CAPI program displays in words the number
the interviewer has typed into the computer and proceeds to the next
question.  If the respondent volunteers a range, there is an option to
report either a range in dollars (and in some cases the upper or lower
bound of a range may be missing--e.g., as in the case where a
respondent answers "greater than a million dollars") or to give a
letter from a range card (the ranges are given below).  If the
respondent answers "don't know" or refuses to answer, the program will
present a request to use the range card.  If the respondent is unable
to use the range card (answers "no" or "don't know"), the program
presents a series of questions known as a "decision tree," which is
specified in greater detail below.  If the respondent refuses when
asked to use the range card, the program proceeds to the next
question.  The exact question text for this sequence is given below.

Because of software limitations, negative ranges presented a special
problem.  It was not feasible to build in negative ranges directly.
As a compromise, interviewers were instructed to collect the ranges in
absolute values and record in a comment box available in the program
the fact that the range was negative.

The shadow variables fall into three large groups.  Codes of less than
90 indicate that data were not originally missing (or that they could
be inferred with high confidence from other information).  Codes
with an integer value from 90 through 993 indicate that the respondent
provided a range response.  The extensive form of the paths through
the range routines encompasses a large number of outcomes, as is
reflected in the number of possible range codes.  For the codes that
indicate a range response, there may also be a decimal component.  A
code with a decimal part equal to 0.5 indicates that the initial
response that the respondent gave to the associated dollar question
was "don't know."  In every other case, there should be no decimal
component to the shadow variable.  Codes of 994 or more indicate that
the associated data value is completely missing.

There is an important exception to the normal assignment of J-codes.
In some cases, it is not known where a reported value should actually
be because a higher-order question was missing.  In setting up the
data, the reported values are put into all possible locations and the
variables all retain the J-codes of the reported values.  Imputation
sets a path through the data, and the values which are imputed to be
inapplicable are given a value of zero, even though their J-codes are
not necessarily one of the codes for inapplicable data (1, 3 or 14).

When columns of a grid need to be shifted after data are removed, the
moved variables retain their original J-codes.

*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
Definitions of the "J" Variables (1998 version)

0  = Originally reported value.  See above for an exception.

1  = Question is inapplicable (e.g., R has no checking account
     so value of checking account is coded as zero.)  NOTE: all
     values of zero in the dataset are in some sense inapplicable
     [also see J-code value 14]; reported values of zero are
     typically stored as -1.

2  = Data moved from another location (e.g., a motorcycle
     misclassified in the automobile grid moved to the other vehicle
     grid); data moved from another location and added to data already
     at the new location (e.g., wage income from spouse reported in
     independent adult part of section Y added to data reported for R
     in Section T); data reported in a "mop-up" field that could be
     directly mapped into the correct final location.  These moves and
     changes may be the result of verbatim responses, interviewer
     comments, or other information.

3  = CAPI error: resolution yields an inapplicable code.
4  = CAPI error: resolution yields a non-missing (non-range) value.

5  = Indicates a value coded directly by FRB from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response or interviewer comments that
     translate directly into a valid response.  Such values indicate
     the exercise of a bare minimum of judgment in encoding the
     content of the text data.  ("Super-no" corrections are included
     here.)
6  = Indicates a value coded directly by NORC from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response.

8  = variable computed from other non-missing variables.

9  = variable overridden by logically equivalent information to
     maintain consistency of data (e.g., when type of property is a
     time share (X1703=25), but R says they own the share alone
     (X1704=1)--rather than saying that the property is a time share
     (X1704=5)--then the response to X1704 is changed to 5).

10 = (1) this code applies to variables where part of the value
     reported was also reported elsewhere and is edited out here
     (e.g., in the case where the wage income of NPEU member is
     reported at X6403 and at X5702 along with income of the PEU,
     the NPEU value is removed from X5702 and J5702=10); (2) this code
     also applies to higher-order variables that must be reset as a
     consequence of editing out a lower-order value entirely
     (e.g., when X6403 and X5702 both contain only the income of the
     NPEU member, the data are reset as X5701=5, J5701=10, X5702=0 and
     J5702=14).

13 = Judgmental override of non-missing reported value.
14 = Inapplicable code generated by any data adjustment,
     (particularly adjustments associated with J-codes 2, 10, 13, 15,
     16, and 17).
15 = Non-stochastic imputation of missing data (typically based at
     least in part on other, non-codeable data).
16 = Override of reported data based on comment/verbatim information
     or information from another question (e.g., X7360)
     (other than codes 2, 5, and 13).  Assigment of this value
     requires both text (verbatim/comment) data and significant
     judgment, or substantial structural information from other
     reported values together with judgment.
17 = Value of originally missing data item implied by/computed from
     other variable(s).  Relatively more judgement is implied by this
     code than a code 8.

25 = This code is used only for the make/model of vehicles.  If either
     the make or the model (but not both) was originally missing, but
     there was sufficient information to approximate the value of the
     vehicle, this code is assigned.

30 = This code indicates that the respondent originally offered to
     provide a dollar range but when the upper and lower bounds of the
     range were asked, a single non-zero value was given for both the
     upper and lower bounds.

ALL RESPONSES THAT FOLLOW HAVE AT LEAST SOME MISSING INFORMATION

90 = Bounding information available based on summary information
     provided by respondent (typically, if a R does not know
     information about items beyond a certain number in a set of
     detailed questions about a larger number of such items, the R is
     asked one or a number of summary questions about all remaining
     instances).
91 = Same as 90, but R gave range data for the summary information.

OTHER CODES FOR MISSING DATA

2050 = Original response was DK.
2052 = Original response missing as a result of missing information for
     a higher-order question (typically a YES/NO cut question).  In
     this case, the higher-order question has been imputed in such
     a way as to render the response appropriate.  Also includes some
     other miscellaneous cases: (1) if a dollar variable was missing
     and DKDOL returned a DK/REF, the corresponding frequency is given
     a missing value code equal to that of the dollar field; (2)
     similarly, for clusters of variables containing a dollar amount
     and percent options.
2053 = Original response was refused
2054 = Original response was "some, DK how many" (see B6).

2056 = Missing value determined from verbatim response by NORC coders.

2060 = Unresolved data problem (none should remain in final dataset).

2079 = Data missing because of questionnaire error, or data not collected.
2080 = Recode variable, missing because data not collected for
       sub-group, data to be imputed.
2081 = Recode variable, some, but not all components originally missing.
2082 = Recode variable, all components originally missing.

2097 = Override of reported information with (at least partially)
       imputed data
2098 = Override of reported/inap./other information with a missing value.

2099 = Used for absent spouse for J104 or J105 when X104 or X105 < 0.

3000 = Data missing because R broke off the interview (each of these
       cases reviewed to be sure that sufficient information is
       reported that the case can count as a "partial accepted as
       complete")

3001 = Program, reporting or recording error.

3002 = Temporary value given to variables containing illegal values.
       These will all be resolved in editing and converted to other
       existing codes.  (includes "range U")

3003 = Illegal zeroes

3004 = Uninformative/irrelevant verbatim response

3005 = Data not available (applies to data from HEF)

3500 = Data set to missing and imputed for disclosure avoidance

General instructions for J variable coding for recoded variables:
  When a recoded variable is taken directly from another single
    X-variable, it should have the same J-variable code.
  When a recoded variable may come from a single variable in the
    original X-variables, or as the result of a calculation based on
    some number of X-variables, it is important to distinguish the
    information content in the J-variables.  As noted above, when the
    value is taken directly, the J-variable should have exactly the
    same value as that for the X-variable's shadow J-variable.
    However, when some calculation is involved, this should be
    reflected in the J-variable -- codes 8, 2081, and 2082.
  When a recode cannot be computed because some part of the underlying
    information was not collected for some subset of cases, the
    recode's J-variable should be coded 9 or 2080.

ANALYSIS WEIGHTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the SCF sample is not an equal-probability design, weights
play a critical role in interpreting the survey data.  The main
dataset contains the final nonresponse-adjusted sampling weights.
These weights are intended to compensate for unequal probabilities of
selection in the original design and for unit nonresponse (failure to
obtain an interview).  The weight (X42001) is a partially design-based
weight constructed at the Federal Reserve using original selection
probabilities and frame information along with aggregate control
totals estimated from the Current Population Survey.  This weight is a
relatively minor revision of the consistent weight series (X42000)
maintained for the SCFs beginning with 1989 (For a detailed discussion
of these weights, see "Consistent Weight Design for the 1989, 1992,
and 1995 SCFs and the Distribution of Wealth," by Arthur B. Kennickell
and R. Louise Woodburn, Review of Income and Wealth, Series 45, Number
2, June 1999, pp. 193-215 or the longer version given on the SCF web
site at http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  The
nature of the revisions to the consistent weights is described in
"Revisions to the SCF Weighting Methodology: Accounting for
Race/Ethnicity and Homeownership" (Arthur B. Kennickell, January 1999,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  A version
of the revised weight has been computed for all the surveys beginning
with 1989, and this variable has been added to the public versions of
the SCF datasets.  Users should be aware that the population defined
by the weights for *each implicate* (see above) is 102.5 million
households: the sum of each of the weights over all sample cases and
imputation replicates is equal to five times the number of households
in the sample universe.

Although the weights should produce reliable results at the level of
broad aggregates (e.g., net worth and income ), it is important to
note that many of the variables collected in the SCF are highly
skewed in their distributions and that many such variables will apply
to only a relatively small fraction of the sample; thus, estimates of
characterstics of such variables may be distorted by outliers.  In the
SCF group at the Federal Reserve, we routinely review our calculations
for the presence of overly-influential outliers, and robust techniques
are applied when appropriate.  We encourage other users to exercise
similar care in analyzing the data.

The issue of weighting in regressions has long been controversial.
Users of the SCF may find two references particularly useful:
(1) Analysis of Complex Surveys, C.J. Skinner, D. Holt, and
T.M.F. Smith (editors), John Wiley and Sons, 1989 (see particularly
pages 8-10, 154-157, and 286-287). (2) The Analysis of Household
Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy, Angus
Deaton, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997 (see particularly pages
67-73).  At the least, users should think carefully about the effects
of weights in their particular models.  Weighted estimates may be
dramatically less efficient than unweighted estimates.  If one is
interested in estimating descriptions of the population--rather than
"structural models"--there are some clear justifications for
weighting.  If weights make a substantial difference in regression
estimates, analysts may want to consider the possibily that their
models omit some key structure that could be controlled for in a way
other than weighting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLING ERROR
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SCF is a scientific instrument designed for the measurement of
behavior.  However, even under ideal operational conditions, the
measurements of the survey are limited in a fundamental way by the
fact that it is based on a sample of respondents rather than the
entire population.  Variability of estimates based on sample data can
be estimated.

Because we are unable to give users any of the most basic sample
information about cases in the dataset, they would be unable on their
own to compute reasonable estimates of the sampling variances of their
estimates.  To facilitate such estimation, we have included a file
of replicate weights and multiplicity factors corresponding to
X42001.  Using detailed information about the original sample design, 
we selected 999 sample replicates from the final set of completed 
cases in a way intended to capture the important dimensions of sample 
variation (for details see "Weighting design for the 1992 Survey of 
Consumer Finances," Arthur Kennickell, Douglas McManus and Louise 
Woodburn, December 1996, http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/
oss2/method.html).  For each survey case and each replicate, the file 
contains a weight (WT1B1-WT1B999) and the number of times the case was 
selected in the replicate (MM1-MM999).  We computed weights for each 
replicate using exactly the same procedures we used for the main 
weights.  Replicate weights were computed only for the first implicate 
of each case.  For many purposes, users will probably want to multiply 
the weight times the multiplicity: in all cases the sum of each of the 
weights times the corresponding multiplicities of the cases equals the 
total number of households.  To estimate the sampling variance of the 
mean of family income, for example, a user would estimate the mean 
999 times using the replicate weights and compute the standard error 
of that estimate.  An estimate of the total standard error
attributable to imputation and sampling is given by 
SQRT((6/5)*imputation variance + sampling variance).

A simple SAS program to compute the standard error due to sampling and
imputation for the mean and median of a given variable is provided
below.  This program may be adapted easily for other types of
calculations.  For example, to compute the standard error of a
proportion, create a zero/one dummy variable to indicate the presence
of the item; the standard error of the mean will be the correct
standard error of the proportion.  To conserve on necessary memory,
the program computes sampling error using blocks of 100 replicate
weights rather than the full set at once.  Users with large amounts of
RAM may wish to increase the size of these blocks, and those with
smaller amounts may wish to decrease the size.

    * MACRO MEANIT;
    * AK May 22, 1998 version;
    * DSN specifies the name of the dataset to be used (the dataset
      should contain the following: the main weight renamed as WGT0, a
      set of variables WGT1-WGT999 equal to the replicate weights
      multiplied by the multiplicity factors, a variable for which
      one wishes to compute the standard error due to imputation and
      sampling for the mean and median, and a variable IMPLIC equal to
      the implicate number of each case)
      VAR contains the name of the variable for which one desires
      standard errors
      PFLAG: blank prints interim statistics/any character string
      (e.g., NO) surpresses printing
      WHERE: defines subsets of data (use IML conventions, e.g.,
        ((X333=3 | X444=4) & X555=5 & X666^=6);
    * NOTE: the calculation excludes observations with missing values
      from the calculation.  Thus, if one wants to make the
      calculation for only non-INAP values, a convenient short cut
      might be to set all such values (normally zero in the main SCF
      database) to a missing value (a WHERE condition would also
      work).  The program assumes that missing value patterns are
      consistent across implicates--if this is not the case, a WHERE
      condition should be used;
    * WARNING: if one uses this MACRO to compute variances for very
      small sub-populations, there is a chance that some of the
      replicates may contain no cases where the condition defining the
      sub-population holds.  In this case, the program will return a
      fatal error;

DISCLOSURE REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A paramount goal of the survey is to protect the privacy of the
participants, who generously shared their personal information.
In light of this goal, the data in this release have been
systematically altered by several means to minimize the possibility of
identifying any survey respondent.  For some discrete variables, small
or unusual cells were collapsed as noted in the individual variable
descriptions below.  Continuous variables were rounded.  Data were
also blurred by other unspecified means.  In addition, a number of
other cases were identified for more extensive treatment.  Some of
these cases were selected on the basis of extreme or unusual data
values; other cases were selected at random.  For each of these cases,
a selection of critical variables was set to missing and statistically
imputed subject to constraints designed to ensure that any distortions
induced in key population statistics would be minimal.  The geographic
identifiers were also systematically altered for a subset of
respondents using imputations methods conditioning on key financial
characteristics.  Where relevant, the codebook provides more detailed
information on cell collapsing and other techniques.

By design, the SCF sample excludes people who are included in the
Forbes Magazine list of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. (see
references in "SAMPLE DESIGN" above).  However, there are several
reasons why respondents with wealth at this level could appear in the
sample anyway.  In the 1998 survey, there were four observations that
had net worth greater than the minumum level needed to qualify for the
Forbes list.  Because it would be very difficult to sufficiently
obscure the identity of such people without rendering their data
virtually useless, it was decided to remove them from the public
version of the datset.  Thus, the public version of the dataset
contains 4,305 of the 4,309 observations in the full dataset.

It is important to note that aside from the cell collapsing, there is
no key in this codebook or in the dataset that would allow users to
identify with certainty either which data items have been smoothed or
otherwise altered, or which cases were selected for imputation of
critical values (that is, the shadow variables in this dataset may not
always reflect the true original status of every variable).  Although
this blurring of the data will have some effect on analysis, that
effect should be negligible in most cases.  For further details
on the procedures taken to protect the identity of respondents, see
"Analyzing the Disclosure Review Procedures for the 1995 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Gerhard Fries, Barry W. Johnson, and R. Louise
Woodbutn, September 1997,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html) and
"Multiple Impution and Disclosure Protection: The Case of the 1995
SCF" (Arthur B. Kennickell, November 1997,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  The
disclosure protections applied to the data are the product of an
agreement between the Federal Reserve Board, NORC, and SOI.  Users who
feel that the restrictions imposed on the public dataset are too
constricting are encouraged to submit written proposals for expanded
data release, and those requests will be given serious consideration
in the release of data from future surveys.

Note that dollar variables, except X3918 X3920,  in the public 
dataset have been rounded according to the following scheme which 
preserves the population mean on average:

COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, medians of financial characteristics estimated from the
SCF should compare well with medians estimated from other surveys
using comparable population definitions.  However, estimates of means
will often differ, largely for two reasons.  First, means of many
financial characteristics may not be very robustly estimated in
surveys that interview only a relatively small number of wealthy
households.  The distribution of many financial characteristics (e.g.,
net worth) is highly skewed, and sparce representation of the upper
tail will translate into a noisy estimate of statistics, such as the
mean, that are strong affected by the top of the distribution.
Second, there may also be a degree of bias in the measurement of some
financial characteristics.  Evidence suggests that there is
differentially higher nonresponse among wealthy households.  Failure
to account for such differences in the creation of analysis weights
leads to a misrepresentation of the size of the upper tail of wealth
and characterstics associated with being in that tail.  By using frame
data for the list sample, the SCF has the means to identify and make
some corrections for such nonresponse.  However, this option is not
available in most other surveys.

The SCF may also be compared with aggregate statistics, such as the
flow of funds accounts (FFA), which are constructed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  An extensive analysis of the
differences in these two sources is provided by Rochelle Antoniewicz
("A Comparison of the Household Sector from the Flow of Funds Accounts
and the Survey of Consumer Finances," Finance and Economics Discussion
Series 1996-26, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June).
As discussed in that paper in detail, there are many conceptual
differences between the SCF and the FFA.  Three of these differences are
particularly noteworthy here.  First, the FFA "household sector"
includes the holdings of nonprofits, and estimates of those holdings
must be made to create a population basis closer to that used in the
SCF.  Second, the financial concepts used in the FFA often differ from
those used in the SCF.  Substantial effort is usually required to
align the concepts in the two sources, and in some cases there is no
clear way of doing so.  Third, both the FFA and the SCF provide
estimates.  Because the two series are developed from independent
sources of information with different statistical properties, it would
be surprising if they yielded precisely the same totals even if the
populations and concepts could be made perfectly consistent.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SCF is a large project that involves intense commitment by many
people.  At the Federal Reserve, the main project staff involved with
the creation of the data has included Gerhard Fries, Arthur
Kennickell, Annelise Li, Amber Lytle, Kevin Moore, Martha
Starr-McCluer, Amy Stubbendick, Annika Sunden, and Brian Surette.
Important support has come from the FRB officer corps, particulary
Edward Ettin and Myron Kwast who have invested their credibility in
making the project possible.  In addition to funding the survey, the
individual members of the Board of Governors have actively encouraged
the development and use of the survey.  Support from the Statistics of
Income Division at the IRS has been essential.  Barry Johnson has been
tireless in his work to obtain the necessary data for the selection of
the list sample, in his work on the disclosure review, and in sharing
the insights he has gained in working with the IRS estate tax data.
Dan Skelly, the director of SOI, and James Nunns at the Office of Tax
Analysis at the Department of the Treasury have encouraged and supported
us through many difficult periods.  At the National Opinion Research
Center at the University of Chicago, very many people have touched the
project in important ways. The project director for the 1998 SCF at
NORC was Lisa Thalji, and the Associate Project Director was Mary Hess.
Their commitment and organization were critical in the success of the 1998
survey.  Geoff Walker tirelessly revised the CAPI software to produce
the best possible instrument for the interviewers, and he provided a
variety of other types of technical support.  The coding of
respondents' verbatim responses was done by Pam Melendez, Darius
Stroud, and Betty Williams.  Pat Smillie was the coordinator for
coding, and Denise Ellison was the coding supervisor.  Deep thanks are
also due to many others at the NORC central office, including Dan
Bartels, Val Geralds, Rachael Harter, Nick Holt, Jim Rogers, Dave
Riemer, Rebecca Smith, Suzanne Turner, Karen Veldman, Robert Wagers,
and Ken Wilmer.  Phil Depoy, president of NORC, provided essential support
and personal encouragement throughout the project.  I apologize to the
many other people at NORC whose names I cannot remember.  One of the
greatest strengths of NORC is its very talented field staff.
Pat Phillips served as the principal liason to the field, and
Sandy Pitzer and Linda Wiedmer served as the Field Project Managers.
The Field Managers included Julie Feldman, Lynn Gallagher, Marty
Hargas, Barbara Lawrence, Susan Miller, Nancy Mutz, Carolyn Nicholas,
Joseph Pierce, and Barbara Watt.  These are all very creative and
dedicated people.  We all deeply mourn the passing of Madeline Lauer,
who was a devoted NORC Field Manager who had signed up to work on the
1998 survey, but who was diagnosed with a terminal illness just before
training began.  The interviewers, some of whom may prefer not to be
named, were the people who did the hardest work.  In 1998, SCF
interviewers included many experienced interviewers--some on earlier
SCFs--and others from a wide variety of backgrounds.  They deserve
the deepest gratitude of all users of the SCF data.  The only people
who gave more than the interviewers were the survey respondents, who
are necessarily anonymous.  May every user remember that some person
gave his or her time in the public interest to create the data that
make their analysis possible.  No set of acknowledgements would be
complete without mentioning three people: Fritz Scheuren, who provided
early and continuing encouragement, insights, and support for the SCF
project; Robert Avery, my predecessor as director of the SCF, is a
colleague who not only created the atmosphere that made the current
development of the project possible, but who continues to contribute
as a sounding board for our ideas; and Dorothy S. Projector, project
director of the Federal Reserve's landmark 1962-63 Survey of Financial
Characteristics of Consumers, set a very high standard for all future
work on household wealth surveys.

As noted in the introduction, there is an additional data file
which contains replicate weights and multiplicity factors to be used in
estimating sampling variances.  The file corresponds to the main
X42001.

The replicate weights are of the form WT1Bi, where i=1,...999
The multiplicity factors are of the form MMi, where i=1,...999

Replicate weights with a given index correspond to multiplicity
factors with the same index.

X100       Indicator for inclusion of income, debt, assets, etc. of an
           absent spouse/partner in the interview.  For simplicity, a
           respondent who is married, but living with a partner, is
           not treated as having an absent spouse for the purposes of
           this constructed variable.  Similarly, a partner of the
           respondent who is married is also not treated as having an
           absent spouse.  When this variable equals one, the 
           employment questions (X4700 etc.) and demographic
           questions (X6101 etc.) are answered for the absent spouse.

X305       The next few questions are about the financial
           institutions that you do business with. 

           With how many financial institutions do you currently have
           accounts or loans, or regularly do personal financial
           business?  Include banks, savings and loans, credit unions,
           brokerages, loan companies, and so forth, but not
           institutions where you have only credit cards or business
           accounts.

           With how many financial institutions do you and your family
           living here currently have accounts or loans, or regularly
           do personal financial business?  Include banks, savings and
           loans, credit unions, brokerages, loan companies, and so
           forth, but not institutions where you have only credit
           cards or business accounts.

X8300      Inferred number of institutions.  When institutions were
           reported (or in some cases, imputed) after the institution
           data were collected (except in the case of bank-type credit
           cards) the CAPI program returned to the institution
           questions for the added institutions.  In some cases,
           interviewers failed to enter the new institution properly,
           so the followup questions were not generated by the CAPI
           program.  X8300 takes the originally reported value of X305
           as its base and adds additional institutions whenever a
           commercial bank, savings and loan, credit union, or
           brokerage was reported without an initial link to the
           institution data.  Where there were more than the 6
           institutions on which detailed information was collected,
           the total number of institutions was augmented and stored
           in X8300.  In cases where any of the first six institutions
           have been inferred from an interviewer error, the detailed
           information (location and how R does business) has been
           imputed.

           Code NUMBER
           -1.  NONE


           Institutions were enumerated by name, and the name was used
           as a text fill later in the interview when, e.g., the R was
           asked to identify the institution where the main checking
           account was held.  To protect the privacy of respondents,
           this variable was not retained in the dataset.

           (What is the name of this financial institution?/
           What is the name of the financial institution where you do
           the most business?/What is the name of the financial
           institution where you and your family living here do the
           most business?)

           [What is the name of the financial institution where you do
           the  (second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth) most business?/
           What is the name of the financial institution where you and
           your family living here do the (second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth)
           most business?

           Once the program had generated questions about the number
           of institutions specified by X305, the program asked:

           Do you have any other financial institutions which we have not
           listed yet?
           (Have you included all your accounts?/Have you included the
           accounts for all the people in your household?)

           If the R recalled an additional account, the program was
           set up to augment the list of institutions until the
           respondent said there were no more.

           If X305 contained a value that indicated that there were
           accounts, but the number was a missing value, the R was
           asked:


X308(#1)   About (name of institution), what kind of institution is
X312(#2)   this?  (Is it a commercial bank, a savings and loan or
X316(#3)   savings bank, a credit union, a finance or loan company, a
X320(#4)   brokerage, or what?)
X324(#5)
X328(#6)   Now, I need a little more information on the institutions
           we've added to the card since the start of the interview.
           (If R added institutions during the interview, the CAPI
           program generated the detailed questions on those
           institutions after the section on financial assets was
           completed.)

           NOTE: CARD 2 was available to the interviewer.  This card
           contains the following in a vertical column: "Commercial
           Bank," "Savings and Loan or Savings Bank," "Credit Union,"
           "Finance or Loan Company," "Brokerage," and "Other."

           NOTE: Throughout the codebook, there are variable which
           are labeled "Recode: type of institution".  In these
           locations, the preceding question asks the respondent
           whether the institution where a loan/account is held is
           the same as one of the ones originally recorded in the
           sequence here.  If it was one of these, the interviewer
           entered a link to the appropriate institution.  If it was a
           new institution and there were fewer than six institutions
           already listed, the interviewer was instructed to follow a
           procedure to add the institution to the existing list of
           institutions.  Once six institutions were recorded in the
           list, the interviewer could either link to an institution
           that had already been recorded or code an institution type
           (e.g., commercial bank).  For the cases where a link was
           made to one of the listed institutions, the recode
           variable contains a code for the institution type obtained
           from matching to the sequence of variables described here.
           Where the institution was one that was outside the scope of
           the list, the recode variable contains a code for the
           institution type as asked directly from the respondent.

           NOTE: Examination of the data suggests that a relatively
           small number of respondents reported that their mortgage
           institution was a finance company and some others reported
           that it was a brokerage.  Examination of the name of the
           institution, which is available for most cases in a
           non-public internal dataset, suggests that the respondent
           misclassified a mortgage company or mortgage broker.

having all types (X3821=5, X3823=5, X3825=5, X3827=5, and X3829=5),
the the CAPI program asked what type of fund the R had and requested
the total amount in mutual funds;  based on the information provided,
these funds were reclassified.  If the R gave a missing value response
to the value of all types of mutual funds that R reported having (J3821<90

this total amount was used as a constraint in the imputation of the

LIFE INSURANCE

X4001      Do you have any life insurance?  Please include individual
           and group policies, but not accident insurance.

           Do you or anyone in your family living here have any life

            1.  *YES
            5.  *NO


X4002      The two major types of life insurance are term and
           cash-value policies.  Term policies pay a benefit if the
           insured person dies, but otherwise have no value.  They are
           often provided through an employer or union, but may also
           be bought by individuals.  Cash-value policies also pay a
           death benefit, but differ in that they build up a value as
           premimums are paid.  Other names for types of cash value
           policies are "whole life" and "universal life."

           Are any of your policies individual term insurance?

If R reported having life insurance (X4001=1), but reports no term
insurance (X4002=5) and no whole life insurance (X4004=5), then the
CAPI program asked R the total face value of all types of life
insurance.  R might also have reported having term insurance, DK
whether other insurance is whole life but still know the face value or
the remaining insurance.  If an amount was provided, it was used as a
constraint on the imputation of the sum of the face value of term and
cash value life insurance.

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working fewer than 20 hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
           these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
           [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero

X4203(#1a)  (SHOW CARD 15)
X4303(#1b)  I would like to know what general type of plan this is.
X4403(#1c)  In one common type ofpension or retirement plan, the monthly
X4803(#2a)  retirement benefit paid is based on a formula usually
X4903(#2b)  involving age, years of service, and salary.  In other
X5003(#2c)  plans, money is accumulated in an account for
            (you/her/him) until (your/her/his) retirement.  Is this
            plan like the formula plan or account plan?

             1.  *FORMULA
             2.  *ACCOUNT
             3.  *COMBINATION OF BOTH TYPES

                 no spouse; no pensions: X4135^=1/X4735^=1; no plans
                 where not currently drawing benefits: X4141=5/X4741=5;

                 X4201<2/X4801<2/fewer than 3 pensions: X4201<3/X4801<3)

            NOTE: CARD 15 contained the three large blocks of text
            centered in a vertical column: Under the heading "FORMULA
            PLAN" is printed "The monthly retirement benefit is usally
            based on a formula involving age, years of work and final
            salary.  Sometimes called a 'defined-benefit' plan".
            Under the heading "ACCOUNT PLAN" is printed "Money is
            accumulated in an account for you until retirement.  For
            example: TIAA/CREF. 401(k) and 403(b) plans, thrift plans
            or ESOPs, defined contribution plans, salary-reduction
            plans, etc."  Under the heading "COMBINATION OF BOTH
            TYPES" is printed "Some combination plans allow employees
            to take a lump sum settlement instead of regular
            retirement benefits if they leave the employer before
            retirement age.  The most common suuch plan is the
            pre-1984 Federal pension plan or CSRS."  Printed below
            these items is "If you have both a formula and an account
            plan, please report them separately."

X8171(#1)  Recode: Unconditional mean wage for occupation group in 1998

           Code number
           0.  Inap. (/no spouse; no 3-digit occupation code for past

           *********************************************************

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working 20 or fewer hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
           these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
           [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
           if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
           occupation.

           How much was the total income you and your family living here
           received in 1997 from all sources, before taxes and other
           deductions were made?

           X5718+X5720+X5722+X5724 because of various operations
           applied to the data for disclosure avoidance.  The details
           of this operation cannot be revealed, but a general
           discription of the process is available in the papers cited

X7650      Is this income unusually high or low compared to what you
           would expect in a "normal" year, or is it normal?

            1.  *High
            2.  *Low
            3.  *Normal

           NOTE: some respondents reported that their 1997 income was
           unusually high (low), but gave a normal income figure at
           X7362 that was higher (lower).  These cases appear to be
           ones where the frame of reference for "normal" has shifted:
           e.g., a student made an unusually large amount last year as
           a student, but in a full-time job now makes more.


           Why is that?

X6765      Code reason income unusually high
            1.  Capital gains
            2.  Sale of assets
            3.  Higher business/self-employment income

           15.  Good economy n.e.c.
           16.  Unexpected income n.e.c.
           17.  Change in household composition
           18.  Salary increase/higher salary; promotion
           19.  Social security/retirement/support payments began or

           22.  Changed jobs
           23.  Qualified for unemployment
           24.  Less able to work now; ill since then; other reason

INTERVIEWER REMARKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The data in this section were obtained in two ways.  First, some
of the data derive from the "household enumeration folder" (HEF) a
largely administrative paper document used by interviewers to select
the designated respondent, to update the area-probability sample, to
record recontact information, and to record information about
non-interviews.  Additional data were collected in the HEF on the
neighborhood in which the respondent lived and on characteristics of
the respondent.  Second, other variables (X6523, X6525, X6526, X6527,
X6528, X6529, X6530, X6531, X6532, X6533, X6534, X6535, X6536, X6724,
X6725, X6726, X6727, X6728, X6729, and X7504) were originally recorded
in "Section ZZ," a separate CAPI program used by interviewers after
the main interview to record the varibles along with other information
about the interview that might be relevant to the data editing.
Not all of the variables collected are described in this section;
only variables similar to those reported in earlier SCFs are included
here.

MAPPING FROM SURVEYCRAFT VARIABLES ("Q-variables") TO SCF VARIABLES
("X-variables)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section provides a rough guide for the equivalence of SCF and
AQ variables.  The mapping is rough because duplicate AQ variables
have been collapsed into one SCF variable, and because some
information has been rearranged to conform to the treatment of data in
the SCF since 1989.  Included in this file are the variables
associated with the DKDOL subroutine, which is discussed in the
introduction to this codebook.
