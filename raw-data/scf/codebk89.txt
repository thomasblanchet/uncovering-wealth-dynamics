This codebook serves as the authoritative guide to the variables
included on the public use version of the 1989 SCF cross-section
dataset.  However, not every variable included in this codebook is
actually in the public use dataset.  A list of the variables included
is given at the end of this documentation.

For a general overview of the findings of the 1989 SCF, see Arthur
B. Kennickell and Janice Shack-Marquez, "Changes in Family Finances
from 1983 to 1989: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,"
Federal Reserve Bulletin, January 1992.

The full public dataset consists of three files in addition to this
codebook file.  The first is the main dataset, which contains most of
the survey variables (a 258 megabyte file in its fully expanded
form, and 3.7 megabytes in the zipped SAS transport version of the
file available here).  The second is the questionnaire.  The third
is a file of replicate weights for use in variance estimation as
described below (42 megabytes in its fully expanded form, and 19.9
megabytes in the zipped SAS transport version of the file available
here).

The public use version of the 1989 SCF cross-section is a SAS dataset
of 258 megabytes.  Unlike the case of our earlier SCFs, there
are not separate files of "raw" and "cleaned" data.  Rather, virtually
every missing variable in the dataset has been imputed and every
variable has a "shadow" variable that describes the original state of
the variable (i.e., whether it was missing for some reason, a range
response was given, etc.).  An exception is reported values which have
been imputed or otherwise altered for purposes of disclosure
avoidance.  Such values are not flagged in any systematic way.  Users
who so desire may use the shadow variables to restore the data to
something very close to their original condition.  The main data
values are stored using variable names corresponding to the numbers
given in the codebook below and having a prefix of "X."  The shadow
variables have the same numbers, but with a prefix of "J."  A list of
the values of the shadow variables follows:

0  = value reported on original tape (includes values reported in the
     questionnaire that were alered during editing).

1  = question is inapplicable (e.g., R has no checking account
     so value of checking account is coded as zero -- NOTE: zero is a
     legitimate value for X-variables only for this value of the
     associated J-variable).

2  = evidence from problem sheets that data moved from another
     location, but no evidence that value was altered,
     or data moved.
3  = evidence from problem sheets that data moved from another
     location, and evidence that value was somehow altered based on
     margin notes or other information.

4  = evidence that data imputed from marginal notes.

5  = 83/86 value brought forward.

8  = recode of survey variables, no missing values in antecedents.
9  = recode of survey variables, insufficient data collected to
     compute value, but not imputed.

12 = in case of regular installment loans where term is DK, non-missing
     typical payment moved to monthly payment section.
 
13 = coded value overridden after editing completed.
14 = inapplicable given hard-code decision (13,15).
15 = hard-coded imputation determined during cleaning.
16 = override of reported 89 data with 86 data.
17 = override of reported 89 data with 83 data.
18 = other panel override of reported data (combination of 16 & 17, logical
     consistency, misc. intuition).

19 = imputation of missing 89 data using 86 data.
20 = imputation of missing 89 data using 83 data.

24 = range card response A: $1 to $500.
25 = range card response B: $501 to $1,000.
26 = range card response C: $1,001 to $2,500.
27 = range card response D: $2,501 to $10,000.
28 = range card response E: $10,001 to $50,000.
29 = range card response F: $50,001 to $250,000.
30 = range card response G: $250,001 to $1,000,000.
31 = range card response H: $1,000,001 to $10,000,000.
32 = range card response I: $10,000,001 to $100,000,000.
33 = range card response J: more than $100,000,000.
34 = range card response < 0 A: -$1 to -$500.                  
35 = range card response < 0 B: -$501 to -$1,000.              
36 = range card response < 0 C: -$10,01 to -$2,500.            
37 = range card response < 0 D: -$2,500 to -$10,000.           
38 = range card response < 0 E: -$10,001 to -$50,000.          
39 = range card response < 0 F: -$50,001 to -$250,000.         
40 = range card response < 0 G: -$250,001 to -$1,000,000.      
41 = range card response < 0 H: -$1,000,001 to -$10,000,000.   
42 = range card response < 0 I: -$10,000,001 to -$100,000,000. 
43 = range card response < 0 J: less than -$100,000,000.

44 = value < 0, amount DK
45 = value < 0, amount NA


49 = variable imputed during editing from margin notes, reimputed.

50 = original response was DK.
51 = original response was NA (includes refusals, interviewer errors,
     and missing data resulting from editing decisions).  Does not
     include data missing as a result of missing higer-order questions.
52 = original response missing as a result of missing information for
     a higher-order question (typically a YES/NO cut question).  In
     this case, the higher-order question has been imputed in such
     a way as to render response appropriate.
53 = refused (available only for aggregate income, income range
     questions, whether filed tax return, and AGI: T3/4/7b/7d).
54 = some, DK how many (see B6).

79 = data missing becaue of questionnaire error, or data not collected

80 = recode variable, missing because data not collected for a
     sub-group, data to be imputed.
81 = recode variable, some, but not all components originally missing.
82 = recode variable, all components originally missing.

88 = for property value, only assessed value given.

98 = override of reported information (e.g., R says has 1 IRA, but
     2 institution types reported) -- value set to missing.

99 = used for absent spouse for J104 or J105 when X104 OR X105 < 0.

100 = Value set to missing while problem with case is being resolved
      (temporary code).

183 = demographic and employment recodes for panel and panel/cross-section
      cases: only 83 data missing.
184 = employment recodes for panel and panel/cross-section cases: 83
      and 86 data missing.
185 = demographic and employment recodes for panel and panel/cross-section
      cases: 83 and 89 data missing. 
186 = demographic, marital history, and employment recodes for panel
      and panel/cross-section cases: only 86 data missing. 
187 = demographic, marital history, and employment recodes for panel
      and panel/cross-section cases: 86 and 89 data missing.
188 = marital history and employment recodes for panel
      and panel/cross-section cases: 83,86 and 89 data missing.
189 = demographic, marital history, and employment recodes for panel
      and panel/cross-section cases: only 89 data missing. 

200 = marital history variable set to missing due to irreconcilable
      inconsistencies between 1986 and 1989 data.


The imputations of missing values provided here are the result
of the sixth iteration of a large model described in a paper I gave at
the annual ASA meetings in 1991 ("Imputation of the 1989 Survey of
Consumer Finances: Multiple Imputation and Stochastic Relaxation).
A copy of the paper is available upon request.  In this dataset, values
have been MULTIPLY-IMPUTED.  The imputations are stored as complete
replicates of each case.  In the release, there are 5 copies of each
survey observation.  Thus, the sum of the weights will be equal five
times the number of families in the U.S. in 1989.  Users should be
careful to make appropriate degrees of freedom adjustments in any
calculations they make using these data.  For an overview of the
theory of multiple imputation and the analysis of multiply-imputed
data, see MULTIPLE IMPUTATION FOR NONRESONSE IN SURVEYS by
Donald B. Rubin, John Wiley and Sons, 1987.

In this codebook, many variables have been grouped in a way different
from the way that they were originally asked (e.g., lines of credit
for homeowners and non-homeowners were originally asked separately --
as noted in the codebook below, these responses have been merged in a
single set of variables).  With the exception of a few variables
(e.g., marital history), the original questions appear in the codebook
with the appropriate variable numbers.  Because question ordering is
important in understanding the effective meaning of many questions,
users of the data are encouraged to consult the questionanaire
(available separately) for a precise guide to where and how the
underlying questions were asked.  Note that there are no summary
variables (e.g., net worth) in the public version of the dataset.

The dataset contains several sets of nonresponse-adjusted sampling
weights.  X42001 is the weight strongly recommended for the analysis
of the data for most purposes.  This variable is a partially design-based
weight constructed at the Federal Reserve using original selection
probabilities and frame information along with aggregate control
totals estimated from the Current Population Survey.  The population
defined by the weights for *each implicate* (see above) is 93.0
million households.  This weight is a relatively minor revision of the
consistent weight series (X42000) maintained for the SCFs beginning
with 1989 (For a detailed discussion of these weights, see "Consistent
Weight Design for the 1989, 1992, and 1995 SCFs and the Distribution of
Wealth," by Arthur B. Kennickell and R. Louise Woodburn, Review of
Income and Wealth, Series 45, Number 2, June 1999, pp. 193-215 or the
longer version given on the SCF web site at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  The nature
of the revisions to the consistent weights is described in "Revisions
to the SCF Weighting Methodology: Accounting for Race/Ethnicity and
Homeownership," by Arthur Kennickell (see SCF web site).  A version of
the revised weight has been computed for all the surveys beginning
with 1989, and this variable has been added to the public versions of
the SCF datasets.  Weights X40125 and X40131 have also been included
in this release for historical reasons.  These weights are partially
design-based weights (see Heeringa, Conner and Woodburn [1994] "The
1989 Surveys of Consumer Finances: Sample Design and Weighting
Documentation") that were originally released with the data.  The
weight X40125 is the preliminary SRC design-based weight used in the
report on the SCF by Janice Shack-Marquez and me in the January 1992
issue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin.  This weight was superceded by
X40131.  Users should be aware that the sum of each of the weights
over all sample cases and imputation replicates is equal to five times
the number of households in the sample universe.

For a variety of reasons connected with disclosure limitation, it is
not possible to give users the details about the SCF sample design that
they would need to compute reasonable estimates of sampling variance
by standard means.  During the construction of X40202, a small set of
replicate weights was created to use for variance estimation.  Because
it was difficult at that time to compute such weights, only eleven
such replicates were computed.  Until this release, these replicate
weights have not been included with the dataset.  They are included
here largely for historical documentation.  In a separate file,
available with the main dataset, we have included a set of replicate
weights computed using the same algorithm as was used for X42001.  
Using detailed information about the original sample design, we 
selected 999 sample replicates from the final set of completed 
cases in a way intended to capture the important dimensions
of sample variation.  For each survey case and each replicate, the
file contains a weight and the number of times the case was selected
in the replicate.  We computed weights for each replicate using
exactly the same procedures we used for X42000.  Replicate weights
were computed only for the first implicate of each case.  For most
purposes, users will probably want to multiply the weight times the
multiplicity: in all cases the sum of the weights times the
multiplicities equals the total number of households.  To estimate the
sampling variance of the mean of family income, for example, a user
would estimate the mean 999 times using the replicate weights and
compute the standard error of that estimate.  An estimate of the
standard error due to these two sources is given by the square root of
the sum of the estimated sampling variance and 6/5 times the
imputation variance.  The replicate weights associated with this
release of the data were recomputed along with the main weight to
ensure consistency with the 1992 and 1995 SCFs.

Unlike earlier releases of the dataset, this one includes all
cross-section cases and most important dollar variables.  However,
the data reported have have been systematically altered by several
means to minimize the possibility of identifying any survey
respondent.  For some discrete variables, small or unusual cells were
collapsed as noted in the variable descriptions below.  Continuous
variables were rounded.  Data were also blurred by other unspecified
means.  In addition, 300 cases were identified for more extensive
treatment.  Some of these cases were selected on the basis of extreme
or unusual data values.  Others of the 300 cases were selected at
random.  For each of the 300 cases, a selection of critical 
variables was set to missing and statistically imputed subject to
constraints designed to ensure that any distortions induced in key
population statistics would be minimal.  Aside from the cell
collapsing, there is no key in this codebook or in the dataset that would
allow users to identify directly either which data items have been
smoothed or otherwise altered, or which cases were selected for
imputation of critical values.

We have spent many hours searching for errors in the data. Many
inconsistencies are actually in the raw data and seem to have no
obvious reconcilliation (most prominently the fact that X5729 -- total
income -- is not always equal to the sum of the income components).
Other types of inconsistencies may have been induced as a byproduct of
imputation, even though elaborate checks are built into the imputation
routines.  We ask our colleagues who use this dataset to help us find
the remaining inconsistencies.

It is likely that some users will have trouble dealing with the data
at first.  If after having framed a focused question and exhausted all
of your local resources your problem persists, you may call Gerhard
Fries  at ((202) 452-2578 or e-mail m1gxf00@frb.gov) or me
((202)-452-2247 or e-mail m1abk00@frb.gov)).  We prefer
correspondence via e-mail.  While we would like to be helpful to you,
please realize that we do not have extensive resources to devote to
user services.  We hope that by persistence, you will almost always be 
able to figure out what you need by consulting the questionnaire and
the codebook below.

                   This weight should be used for all estimations
                   using the final 1989 SCF data for which weights are
                   appropriate.


Replicate weights corresponding to X42001

As noted in the introduction, there is a separate file which contains
multiplicity factors and replicate weights corresponding to X42001
for use in estimating sampling variances.

The replicate weights are of the form WT1Bi, where i=1,...999
The multiplicity factors are of the form MMi, where i=1,...999

Replicate weights with a given index correspond to multiplicity
factors with the same index.

                  set to zero except for a few cases where the person
                  might plausibly be married.  However, it is
                  important to note that because this question was not
                  asked of everyone under 18, this set of married
                  people under 18 is not indicative of the true number

NOTE: THERE MAY BE SOME DEVIATIONS FROM THE STRUCTURE OF INAPPLICABLE

8112 (R)    R:    Average for occupation group of fraction of last 52

8169 (R)    R:    Unconditional mean wage for occupation group in 1989
8170 (S)

     For each occupation group, regressions were run separately for
     males and females of the log of annualized wages on a constant,
     a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35), MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy
     variable for part-time employemnt (1 = working 20 or fewer hours
     per week), a dummy variable for self-employment (1 = self-
     employed), a dummy for race (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and
     dummy variables for years of education (1 = : 12 years of
     education, more than 13 to 15 years of education, 16 years of
     education, more than 16 years of education).  If there were
     too few people in a CPS 3-digit occupation group, either the SCF
     case was matched to a neighboring occupation group, or the match
     was made at the level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of
     the model coefficients may be identically zero where there are 
     too few cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS to identify the
     coefficients.

INFORMATION LINKED FROM 1989 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY BY OCCUPATION CODE
FOR PRIOR JOB

8171 (R)    R:    Unconditional mean wage for occupation group in 1989
8172 (S)

     For each occupation group, regressions were run separately for
     males and females of the log of annualized wages on a constant,
     a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35), MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy
     variable for part-time employment (1 = working 20 or fewer hours
     per week), a dummy variable for self-employment (1 = self-
     employed), a dummy for race (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and
     dummy variables for years of education (1 = : 12 years of
     education, more than 13 to 15 years of education, 16 years of
     education, more than 16 years of education).  If there were
     too few people in a CPS 3-digit occupation group, either the SCF
     case was matched to a neighboring occupation group, or the match
     was made at the level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of
     the model coefficients may be identically zero where there are
     too few cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS to identify the
     coefficients.

MARITAL HISTORY RECODE VARIABLES 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  When sufficient underlying data were available, the following
  marital history variables were constructed directly.  For 1986 panel
  cases these variables were computed using marital history information
  obtained in 1986 SCF updated with new quesions; for new cross-section
  cases and those with no 1986 interview, these variables were computed
  using new questions.  Where sufficient data were not collected to
  infer this information directly, the missing information was imputed.
  See the panel and cross-section questionnaires for the underlying
  questions.

                   worse, or about the same as it has over the past five
                   years?

3002       H17.   (RB, P. 2)   Thinking about the loan or mortgage that you
                   took out most recently, what was the main reason you chose
                   the lender that you did?  (Was it because of the location
                   of their offices, because they had the best interest
                   rates, because you were able to obtain many services at
                   one place, because they were recommended by someone else,

3008        J2.    (RB, P. 3)  In deciding how much of their (family) income
                   to spend or save, people are likely to think about
                   different financial planning periods.  In planning your
                   (family's) saving and spending, which of the time periods
                   listed on this page is most important to you (and your

3021       J7.    (RB, P. 7)   Now I'd like to ask a few questions about how
                   you see various risks.  First, on a scale from 0 to 10,
                   where 0 equals almost no risk and 10 equals very great
                   risk, what do you think is the risk that the U.S. economy
                   will experience a major depression sometime during the
                   next ten years or so?

3022        J8.    (RB, STILL ON P. 7)   And what number would you give to
                   the risk that the U.S. economy will experience double

3023       J9.    (RB, P. 8)   On a different scale, how would you rate the
                   retirement income you (expect to receive/are receiving)
                   from Social Security and job pensions?

3024        J10.   (RB, P. 9)   When making major decisions about borrowing
                   and saving, some people shop around for the very best
                   terms while others don't.  Where would your family be on
                   the scale?

                        of the interview to another, circle the item out, and
                        enter it in the new place.  Be sure to place a note at
                        the old place stating where the item was moved to and
                        why.  Add another note at the new place stating where
                        the item was moved from.

Explanatory       4.    Explanatory notes should also be made (in addition to
Notes                   item 3 above) whenever a decision is made which might
                        not be apparent to someone reviewing the interview. 
                        THE REASON FOR YOUR EDITING SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR.

Missing           5.    Edit a response NA (NOT ASCERTAINED) whenever:
Responses (NA's)
                        a.  A question was skipped which should have been
                            asked.

                        b.  R refused to answer a question and there is no
                            'REFUSED' box.

The Golden Rule   6.    READ ALL MARGINAL NOTES and the THUMBNAIL SKETCH (on
                        the back page) and utilize the information contained
                        in them in your editing.  If any information from them
                        will be lost due to following the editing
                        instructions, or if it contradicts other information,
                        or you do not know how to incorporate it, see the
                        Editing Supervisor.  WE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE ANY
                        IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONTAINED IN MARGINAL NOTES.
Control           7.    MAKE SURE CONTROL QUESTIONS ARE CHECKED
Questions
                        a.    If a control question was left blank but the
                              questions contingent upon it were answered, you
                              can edit the control question to agree with the
                              contingent Q's.

                        b.    If a control question was left blank and the
                              questions contingent upon it were also left
                              blank, the control question should be NA'd,
                              unless the I'wer has circled or underlined a
                              skip instruction at the control Q indicating
                              which box was meant.  Then the appropriate
                              control box may be edited in.

                        c.    If, however, the control question was checked
                              and the series of questions contingent upon it
                              were left blank, the control question should be
                              left as is and the contingent questions that
                              follow should be NA'd.

Ranges and        8.    If a range is given, circle it out and edit it to the
Rounding                midpoint, rounding when necessary to the nearest whole
                        number.  If the midpoint should be halfway between two
                        whole numbers, edit it to the odd number.

Card B            9.    Whenever CARD B was used, the I'wer should have 
                        recorded a letter; edit in the appropriate numeric
                        code for that category from the Card B code below next
                        to the I'wers letter.  Watch for dollar ranges in
                        which the I'wer recorded the dollar ranges from CARD B
                        rather than the corresponding letter.  These will be
                        characterized by dollar ranges where the first number
                        ends in 01 and the range reads the same as on CARD B. 
                        Edit these as though the letters C-J were given.  Do
                        not, however, assume that the ranges "Less than $500"
                        or "$500-$1000" are the same as "A" & "B" on CARD B. 
                        Edit these normally.  If 2 letters are given as a
                        range (e.g., "C-D"), edit these to the number on the
                        lower end of the range for the second letter given
                        ("2,501" for the above example is the lower end of the
                        "D" range).

                                         CARD B CODES

                        IW'ERS            INDICATED                     
                        LETTER            RANGE                         CODE

                        A                 LESS THAN $500                9-980
                        B                 $500-$1,000                   9-981
                        C                 $1,001-$2,500*                9-982
                        D                 $2,501-$10,000*               9-983
                        E                 $10,001-$50,000*              9-984
                        F                 $50,001-$250,000*             9-985
                        G                 $250,001-$1 MILLION*          9-986
                        H                 $1 MILLION-$10 MILLION*       9-987
                        I                 $11 MILLION-$100 MILLION*     9-988
                        J                 MORE THAN $100 MILLION*       9-989

                        * If these ranges are found, you can assume the R gave
                        the range from CARD B instead of the letter, and edit
                        to the CODE specified above.

Modified          10.   Do not make adjustments to qualified amounts such as
Amounts                 "a little more," "over $X".  Do, however, use the
                        special codes listed below for the following:
                              
                              "over 1 million"   =   1,111,111
                              "over 10 million"  =  11,111,111
                              "only a little";   =  00 000 001
                              "not much"                      
                              

Cents Recorded    11.   If dollars and cents are recorded in amount fields
                        OTHER THAN HOURLY WAGES, circle out the cents portion. 
                        However, if you are using such a number for
                        calculations, use the cents.
 
Supervisor's      12.   When an editor makes a decision with the help of an
Decisions               editing supervisor or a study director, he/she should
                        record the initials of the person who helped them next
                        to the explanatory note.

Editors' Problem 13.   The purpose of the "Problem Sheet" is to provide a 
Case Summary            more complete description of certain types of problem
Sheet                   cases.  The information will be used to review
                        decisions made, to provide additional data for the
                        imputation process, and to give a more complete
                        picture of the case than the data alone allows.  These
                        sheets should be filled out in all the following
                        circumstances:

                        a.    Whenever there are marginal notes or other
                              volunteered information that is not captured in
                              the editing/coding, especially dollar amounts
                              and including responses to questions that
                              Interviewers asked in error.

                        b.    When a decision has been made that was somewhat
                              arbitrary and could have been made another way
                              using the information provided.  In these cases,
                              all information relevant to the decision should
                              be recorded.

                        c.    Wherever specifically instructed to do so in the
                              Edit Instructions.

                        d.    When requested to do so by the Editing
                              Supervisor.

                        e.    When an item must be NA'd because only "partial"
                              information is known, record the "partial"
                              information which would otherwise be lost.

                        f.    When significant detail is volunteered about
                              assets or debts in "mop-up" questions which will
                              not otherwise be incorporated into the data.

                        g.    When certain "wide" ranges are edited to their
                              midpoints they should also be recorded.  These
                              "wide" ranges are whenever:

                              THE TOP OF              THE RANGE WIDTH
                              THE RANGE IS...   AND   IS AT LEAST...  

                              UNDER 100,000           10,000 or more
                              100,000-1,000,000       100,000 or more
                              OVER 1,000,000          1,000,000 or more

                        Problem Sheets should be written in BLACK PENCIL or
                        INK.  Complicated or complex marginal notes and
                        problems can be xeroxed and attached.  They should be
                        left in the Interview and removed by the check-editor.

Double Counting   14.   Editors need to be continually on the lookout for
                        instances where the respondent has reported the same
                        information twice.  In many cases, a marginal note
                        from the I'wer will signal double-counting; if the
                        note is clear, edit accordingly; if it is not so
                        clear, you will have to use your best judgment and, if
                        necessary, see the Editing Supervisor.  In all cases,
                        where a marginal note leaves significant doubt about
                        whether or not an amount is double-counted, put it on
                        a Problem Sheet, whether your best judgment has led
                        you to edit it out or not.

                        In some cases, you will suspect double-counting only
                        because the same amount occurs in two different
                        places.  If the number is a simple, whole amount (such
                        as $2,000), you will only be able to suspect, but do
                        nothing.  If, however, the number is precise (say,
                        $2,212, or better yet, $2,212.48), you may (depending
                        on the circumstances) have clear evidence for double-
                        counting.  See the Editing Supervisor if it is not
                        certain.

                        The question-by-question instructions that follow will
                        include specific instructions where double-counting is
                        likely to occur and should be watched for, so be
                        especially alert in these places.

                        In some cases where double-counting is found, data
                        will be removed from one location; in other cases, the
                        double counting will be allowed to stay in both
                        places.  Cases of special note follow:

                        Section M:  A debt owed by R or other PEU member to a
                        (M12-M12b)  family business listed at M12-M12b can
                                    also be reported at H4-H14.

                        Section R:  Amounts listed as cash settlements at R52c
                        (R52-R52d)  can be double-counted in other sections. 
                                    If the cash settlement is the source of
                                    funds, they may be validly double-counted
                                    as investments or holdings in accounts.

                        Section Y:  Information that appears in Section Y as
                        (Y33-Y40b)  assets or debts of Financially Independent
                                    household members and in the other
                                    sections of the I'w will be removed from
                                    the other sections and left in Y33-Y40b,
                                    with the exception of the data on R's home 
                                    (Y39-Y39c).

                        Section X:  Assets that appear in Section X and also
                                    in earlier sections may be left in both
                                    places, since Section X refers to the
                                    source of the assets, and the earlier
                                    sections about how it's currently held.

                        Section T:  Income amounts that are reported in other
                                    places in the interview and in Section T
                                    should be left in both places.  Section T
                                    asks for all income and stands
                                    independently of the other sections except
                                    where noted.

General Rule      15.   If it is necessary to split $ amounts in order to move
for Splitting           only a part of a debt, income, or asset to either a
Items                   different place in the Interview or out of the
                        interview, one should use all available evidence and
                        common sense to decide on the proportions.  If no
                        evidence at all is available, you should split the
                        amount(s) in equal parts.  IN ALL UNCLEAR CASES,
                        however, you must get the help and advice of the
                        Editing Supervisor or have the Editing Supervisor
                        review the procedure you used and you must write it on
                        a Problem Sheet.

Financially       16.   The information about financially independent adults
Independent             living in the HU is to be edited out of all sections
Adults                  except the HHL and:

                        a.    Section Y, where their assets and debts are
                              recorded.

                        b.    M9b, where they can legitimately be recorded as
                              working in R/S's business.

Editing          17.   a.    When adding or deleting columns to or from a
Grids                         grid be sure the checkpoints at the bottom of
                              the grid are edited to reflect the changes made;
                              also change the #'s in the phrase "ONLY ___
                              LOANS (SAVINGS ACCTS, etc.)" so they agree.

                        b.    After editing out columns, renumber the
                              remaining columns by circling out the #'s in the
                              column headings.

                        c.    If an item is edited out of a full grid, thus
                              creating an empty column, and there is
                              information entered in the following mop-up Q's,
                              move it forward into the empty column.  

                        d.    If amounts from the "mop-up" questions following
                              a grid must be entered into a grid column and
                              the amount in the mop-up Q is a lump sum of more
                              than one item, split the amount proportionately. 
                              If unclear how to split, see the Editing
                              Supervisor.  In any case, write up what you did
                              on a Problem Sheet.

                        e.    After all deletions or additions to a grid take
                              care to edit the control # entered in the box
                              before the grid to the correct new total # of
                              items (i.e., after editing a "tractor" out of
                              the vehicle grid, which also contains a car and
                              pick-up truck, be sure to edit the control box
                              at G25a to "2").

"Partners"        18.   For the purposes of this study, a "Partner" is assumed
                        to play the same financial role in a P.E.U. as does a
                        "Spouse" and, for this reason, "Partners" are handled
                        in the Interview exactly the same as "Spouses."  If
                        you, however, think you have found evidence that an
                        Interviewer did not treat a "Partner" the same or that
                        a particular "Partner" might be better considered
                        (financially) a "Friend" or "Roommate", bring the
                        problem to the attention of the Editing Supervisor and
                        write them on a Problem Sheet.

Confidential     19.   If confidential information (such as names, names of 
Info                    businesses, etc.) is found in the interview or in the
                        TN, you should blot it out with a black pen.  If
                        information would be lost because of this, edit non-
                        identifying information in to replace it in green
                        pencil (i.e., if the name of R's business is written
                        in the TN, blacken it out and write in "R's
                        business").

Loan/Mortgage     20.   If a marginal note indicates that a Mortgage or Reg.
Payments                Installment payment reported is not the payment amount
                        agreed on (for example, if R is "prepaying" on a
                        loan), edit the payment to the payment amount formally
                        agreed to (or NA it if that amount is not known) and
                        write it and the amount actually being paid on a
                        Problem Sheet.

Checking Type of  21.   In the grid in Section A, R is asked to enter
Financial Inst.         information on the financial institution he/she does
                        business with in columns labelled "INSTITUTION #1-#6". 
                        In later grids at Q's D36, D51, D53h, D64, D74, E33,
                        G22, G38, H14, N4, N19 and N24, these "INSTITUTIONS"
                        are referred to in code boxes 01-06.  In these Q's
                        only one box should be checked in each column of the
                        grid.  If more than one is checked you should edit it
                        to one using the following rules:

                        a.    If category 1-6 and category 11-97 are checked,
                              edit it to only category 1-6 if, on checking at
                              A6, it is found that category 1-6 is the same
                              type of financial institution as category 11-97.
                              
                        b.    If they are found to be different types, or more
                              than one of category 11-97 boxes are checked,
                              see the Editing Supervisor.

                        IF "FINANCIAL INST" Q IS "CHECK ALL THAT APPLY"

                        However, at D68b, N13, N22c, N40c and N45 the
                        instructions in the questions are to "(CHECK ALL THAT
                        APPLY)".  For these you should ONLY make sure that the
                        number of items mentioned at the beginning of the
                        sequence is not LESS THAN the number of institutions
                        checked.  If they are, then see the Editing
                        Supervisor, unless rule a. above applies.

Edit Fractional  22.   At various places in the Interview (D30, D45, D58, E9,
Years                   E25, G16, G32, H8) R is asked to respond with ___# YRS
                        or ___# PYMTS.  If the responses to any of these is a
                        fractional number of years in the # YRS blank (e.g.,
                        "1-1/2" YRS), these should be edited out of the # YRS
                        blank and the corresponding number of payments should
                        be computed and edited into the # PYMTS blank, as per
                        the following:

                        a.    At D30, E9 and E25 the Q just before or
                              following specifies the frequency with which the
                              payments are  made (i.e., $___ PER ___) and the
                              number of payments would be computed from that
                              (e.g., if "1-1/2 YEARS" paid PER "QUARTER" to
                              "6" # PYMTS).

                        b.    For the rest, the # of payments should be
                              computed assuming one payment per month (e.g.,
                              "1-1/2" YRS = "18" # PYMTS).

                        c.    If any marginal notes or information should
                              indicate that some other "regular" frequency of
                              payments is reported than the frequency formally
                              agreed on (because the loan is being prepaid,
                              for instance), then use the frequency agreed
                              upon to compute the # of payments and it should
                              also be noted on the Problem Sheet.

$___ PER ___      23.   Throughout this interview, dollar amounts are asked
                        for as $___ PER___ where the PER frequency is left
                        optional for the R.  These are coded in two variables
                        and the "PER" variable contains codes for "WEEK",
                        "BIWEEKLY", "MONTH", "QUARTER", "YEAR" and "Other-MAKE
                        A CARD" and, in addition, "DAY" when wages are asked
                        for.  Thus, THERE IS NO REASON FOR YOU TO EDIT THESE
                        UNLESS SPECIALLY INSTRUCTED, even if the Q asks for an
                        answer in a different time period than the R answers
                        in (e.g., N49j asks for "yearly premium"; you should
                        not edit a response of $"20" PER "MONTH").

$___ PER MONTH          If, however, the time period is specified in the
                        format (e.g., $___ PER MONTH), you should edit a
                        response in any other time period to a response
                        consistent with the time period specified in the
                        format (e.g., at H9 a response of $"20" PER "week"
                        should be edited to $"86" PER MONTH).


Grid Control      24.   At the beginning of most of the grids in the interview
Boxes                   (at D53, E2a, E15, G2, G7a, G25a, H3, M5, N3, N16a,
                        N23a, R18, R51a, R52a, R53a and X2) are large boxes
                        which function as CONTROL BOXES for the grid.  The
                        number in the box should be equal to or greater than
                        the number of items recorded in the grid.

                        a.    If the grid does not have a set of "mop-up"
                              questions at the end of it, in which more than
                              one item may be lumped, then the number in the
                              grid will match or be greater than the number of
                              items entered in the columns of the grid.

                        b.    If the grid does have a set of "mop-up"
                              questions at the end, then the number in the box
                              must be at least as large as the number of
                              columns in the grid plus the number known to be
                              in the mop-up questions.

                        c.    If you edit items into or out of a grid, you
                              must edit the control box for it, to keep it
                              consistent with the grid and mop-up questions.

Gift/Inheritance  25.   Throughout the interview (at D15b, d & f, D20, E20,
Boxes                   E36b and E37a), when the value of an asset is asked, a
                        "GIFT/INHERITANCE" box is included.  Whenever you
                        encounter one of these and marginal notes or
                        information says that the asset, or part of the asset,
                        was a gift or inheritance, you should:

                        a.    Make sure the box is checked.

                        b.    Make sure the value given was the value of the
                              asset when it was received.

                        c.    If an asset was received as a gift or
                              inheritance in parts, at different times, see
                              the Editing Supervisor.

Business Debts   26.   In Sections G, H, N and at E1-E13b you are instructed
and Assets              to edit out "business" debt or assets in order not to
                        double-count them, as they are assumed to be included
                        in Section M.  Whenever so instructed, we mean
                        "business" debts and assets to be defined as follows:

                        a.    The "business" is a business that R or some
                              other PEU member owns or has an interest in
                              which is included in Section M as an active or
                              passive business.  

                              If R or a PEU member does self-employed work but
                              does not consider it to constitute a "business"
                              (and does not list it in Section M), then any
                              income producing assets they use or debt they
                              incur for it are "personal" asset and debt and
                              should be left in.

                              An example of this would be an R who owns a tow
                              truck (which he still owes money on) to do part-
                              time towing, but does not consider that he has a
                              business, so answers M3 "NO".  You would leave
                              his tow truck in the Section G grid.

                        b.    The "business asset" should be owned "in the
                              name of" the business rather than being owned as
                              a "personal" asset by the PEU.  Likewise, the
                              business should be liable for the debt rather
                              than the PEU.

                              Thus, if R borrows money for his business in his
                              name and he is liable for it, it is not
                              "business debt."  Also, if R's business owns an
                              asset (like a car), but R uses it, it is a
                              "business asset."

                              NOTE:  Solely owned proprietorships (see M9d)
                              are particular problems and in general you
                              should consult the Editing Supervisor if you
                              encounter "business" debt or assets for a solely
                              owned proprietorship outside of Section M.

            AND TO LOCATE TROUBLE SPOTS IN THE INTERVIEW.  UNDERLINE USEFUL
            INFORMATION IN GREEN.

HHL         CHECK WHETHER THE INTERVIEW SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN.  If you find
BOX         an interview taken:

            1.    where the current PEU did not live in the HU at the time the
                  I'wer first went to the HU (except for the list
                  'SPEC' sample).

            2.    where the R is not a member of the PEU.

            3.    at a place which does not fit our definition of a HU (except
                  for the list 'SPEC' sample).

            Take it to the Editing Supervisor.  The decision whether to accept
            it or not will be made elsewhere.

HHL         CHECK THE LISTING BOX AND EDIT OUT NON-HU MEMBERS
BOX
            1.    The listing box should contain all persons living in the
                  housing unit at the time the interviewer first had contact
                  with the household.  

            2.    It should not include visitors or persons who are not
                  currently living in the HU. 

           3.    Edit out non-HU members (by circling in green) and writing
                  an explanatory note.  Use information from the HHL as well
                  as the rest of the Interview and the TN.  In cases where the
                  situation is complex, the final test is whether or not the
                  person could have, theoretically speaking, been interviewed
                  somewhere else at the time that the interviewer CALLED ON
                  THE HU for the first time.  In order to ascertain the date
                  of the interviewer's first call it is necessary to obtain
                  this information from the Cover Sheet in the Field Control
                  Office.  See a Check Editor or Supervisor for this.  As much
                  as possible, the judgment of the Interviewer should be
                  maintained.  If it is unclear if a person should be included
                  or not and the Interviewer has included them (and thus their
                  financial information), then usually we should include them. 
                  Likewise, if it would mean NA'ing a lot of data because the
                  Interviewer did not not include them, then we shouldn't.

            4.    If you edit anyone out of the HHL box you must also edit out
                  any financial information for the person from the interview. 
                  You should take any such cases to the Editing Supervisor and
                  you must write it up on a Problem Sheet.

            5.    If you edit any children of R, Spouse or Partner out of the
                  Listing Box you must edit them into Y5-Y5b (the number of
                  children of R and Spouse/Partner living elsewhere).

HHL COL C   PRECODE R AND S/P's DOB, COMPUTED AND IMPUTED AGES

            1.    Transfer R's (Y3 on p.107) and Spouse/Partner's (Y19 on
                  p.114) Date of Birth to the "DOB" blanks in the large boxed
                  stamp under the U of M seal on the I'w facesheet.

            2.    Compute R's and S/P's ages at the time of the Interview from
                  their Date of Births and enter them in the "COMP" age boxes
                  in the large boxed stamp on the facesheet.

                  a.    Use the Date of IW" at 3 on the facesheet to compute
                        these ages.  If more than one date is entered there,
                        use the earliest.

                  b.    If birth year is NA or DK, code COMP AGE '99'.

           3.    Check the Computed "COMP" ages for R and S/P against their
                 reputed ages in Column C of the HHL box and:

                  a.    If they are both the same or there is only a one or
                        two year difference between them, enter the "COMP" age
                        in the "IMPUT" (imputed) age boxes next to the "COMP"
                        age boxes on the facesheet.

                  b.    If there is more than a two year difference between
                        the computed ages in the "COMP" boxes and the reputed
                        ages in COL C of the HHL box, then:

                        1)    Try to reconcile the difference using all
                              available information (specified below) and, if
                              you can, enter that imputed age in the "IMPUT"
                              age boxes.  

                              However, if other information leaves doubt as to
                              what R's or S/P's "correct" age should be, then:

                        2)    Enter the mid-point of the computed age and the
                              reputed age in the imputed age boxes.

HHL COL D  CHECK MARITAL STATUS AND MOVE SPOUSE/PARTNER TO LINE 2:

            1.    Check that the marital status for R and Spouse/Partner is
                  the same -- either both married or both living with a
                  partner (M or P).  If there are any discrepancies, bring
                  them to the attention of a supervisor.

            2.    If R reports "married", but is not currently living with
                  his/her spouse, edit the spouse out of the listing box (if
                  listed) and code R as either '7' or '8' as per the code
                  below, by printing "7" or "8" next to "M" in Col. D.  These
                  cases must be entered on a Problem Sheet.

                  
                  ABSENT SPOUSE CODE:                                      
                                                                           
                  7.   Spouse is institutionalized or otherwise not        
                       eligible to be sampled (out of U.S., living on      
                       military base, in nursing home, in prison, etc.)    
                                                                           
                  8.   Other non-resident spouses, including those living  
                       elsewhere because of job; moved and R will follow   
                       later; "commuter marriage," etc.                    
                  

                  You should then:

                  a.    Edit the Interview with the debts, assets and income
                        of the missing spouse being included or not being
                        included depending on how the Interviewer conducted
                        the interview; i.e., if the Interviewer included them,
                        then leave them included; if the Interviewer excluded
                        them, then exclude them while editing.
                 b.    Pre-code the "appropriate" absent spouse code,
                        specifying whether or not the missing spouse's
                        financial information has been included in Sections A-
                        X nor not, in the upper left corner of page 1 using
                        the code below:

                        
                        ABSENT SPOUSE PRECODE:                            
                                                                          
                        1.   The absent spouse's financial information is 
                             included in Sections A-X.                    
                                                                          
                        5.   The absent spouse's financial information is 
                             not included in Sections A-X.                
                        

                  c.    If there is a Spouse Booklet for the missing Spouse,
                        leave it in and edit it.  If there is not a Spouse
                        Booklet, you should get a blank Spouse Booklet and
                        edit in as much information as you have.

                  d.    Edit CHECKPOINTS at R49, Y7 and Y16 to include the
                        missing Spouse.

            3.    If the spouse/partner is not listed on the second line,
                  renumber the HH members, giving the spouse/partner #2.  Draw
                  an arrow from the S/P to line 2 indicating that the
                  spouse/partner should be entered on Line 2.

            4.    NOTE:  "S" means "Separated" (not "single").  "NM" means
                  "Never Married."

            5.    If a child/stepchild of R/S is over 18 and marital status is
                  not marked, code it 'NA'.


HHL COL E  PRECODE RESIDENT STATUS

            Read over any marginal notes and use the following code for each
            person in the HHL box.

                             RESIDENT STATUS CODE
      
            1.   An adult or child who is marked "YES" in COL E or a person
                 not marked in COL E who has no marginal notes indicating  
                 any irregularities.                                       
                                                                           
            2.   A person who is a child under 18 who lives at this HU for 
                 only part of the year (e.g. joint custody; "summers spent 
                 with R, school year with spouse").                        
                                                                           
            3.   R's or S's child/grandchild 18 or over who goes away to   
                 school for part of the year.                              
                                                                           
            4.   Another adult who lives at this HU only part of the year  
                 (e.g., R's parent who lives with R for 6 months and with  
                 another relative for 6 months); living here temporarily.  
                                                                           
             5.  "NO" is marked in COL E and no explanation given.         
                                                                     
      MAKE   9.  Some other situation, not codeable above, e.g., a foster  
      CARD       child when COL E is left unmarked and there is no         
                 indication how it is to be marked.                        
      

            For codes 2-4 and 7, circle out the YES or NO response and enter
            the new code in the middle of COL. E (between the 'S' and the
            '5').  For codes '1' and '5', underline the "1" or "5" in green.


HHL COL F  PRECODE THE ECONOMIC UNIT

            Code the "economic unit" to which each person in the listing box
            belongs.  Enter the code to the left of the center bar of COL. F,
            under 'FINANC DEPEND'.  Use the following code; R is always coded
            '1'.  

                                   E.U. CODE
            
            1.   THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC UNIT always contains R, R's           
                 Spouse/Partner and their children under 18.  In addition,  
                 it contains their children 18-22 not marked INDEPENDENT    
                 as well as all others listed who are marked FINANCIALLY    
                 DEPENDENT.  It also includes anyone not marked in COL F    
                 for whom there is no evidence to indicate that they are    
                 FINANCIALLY INDEPEND.                                      
                                                                            
            2.   THE SECONDARY ECONOMIC UNIT contains the first FINANCIALLY 
                 INDEPENDENT adult listed and any other adult or child who  
                 are financially dependent on that person, such as a the    
                 the independent person's spouse or their children.         
                                                                            
            3.   THE THIRD ECONOMIC UNIT contains the next FINANCIALLY      
                 INDEPENDENT person and persons clearly dependent on them.  
                                                                            
                 OTHER ECONOMIC UNITS are identified and numbered           
                 consecutively (4-7).                                       
            

            If it is unclear whether a person is FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT or
            INDEPENDENT or which EU a person should be a member of, see the
            Editing Supervisor.


EU MEMBERS  The debts, assets and income of all PEU members (coded 1) should
FINANCIAL   be included in Sections A-X and none of them should be included in
INFO IN     Y33-Y43.  Likewise, all persons not in the PEU (i.e., in 2nd, 3rd,
WRONG PLACE etc. EU) should have their finances reported in Y33-Y40b and
            should not be reported in Sections A-X (with the exception of
            house value and mortgage information to be explained later). 
            Thus, if you edit anyone into or out of the PEU or you find any
            evidence that anyone's finances are reported in the wrong place,
            you must edit them to agree with the HHL box and it should be
            entered on a Problem Sheet.  If there are any doubts concerning
            this issue, you should bring the Interview to the Editing
            Supervisor.


PARTNER     If any Spouse or Partner is marked "FINANC INDEP":
OR SPOUSE
MARKED      1.    If it is a partner marked "INDEP" and their finances are
INDEP.            clearly reported in Y33-Y43 and not in Sections A-X the
                  "partner" should be edited to "friend" in the HHL box.  If
                  their finances are included in Sects. A-X and not in
                  Y33/Y43, edit COL F of the HHL box to 'FINANC DEPEND'.

            2.    If it is a spouse marked "INDEP", COL F should be edited to
                  "FINANC DEPEN".  In either of the above cases, the Interview
                  should be taken to the Editing Supervisor and a Problem
                  Sheet written up.


UNDER 22    If a person under 22 years old is marked "INDEP":
MARKED
INDEP       1.    If it is clear that their finances are reported in Y33-Y43
                  and not in Sections A-X, leave things as they are.

            2.    If their finances have not been included in Y33-Y43, but
                  instead in Sections A-X, edit them to "FINANC DEPEND".



               SECTION A:  ATTITUDES AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

A5, A5M     Check that the number entered at A5 agrees with the number entered
            in the box at A5m.  If it does not, see the Editing Supervisor.


A5m         Edit the # INST entered in the box at A5m is equal to or greater
            than the number of Institutions recorded in A6-A9 for Columns #1-
            #6.  If R reports more than 6 institutions, the number in this box
            may be greater than 6 even though only 6 institutions will be
            listed in the grid.


A6-A9       FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GRID

            1.    Columns should be neither added to this grid nor deleted. 
                  If, however, more than six institutions are entered in the
                  columns, edit those beyond six out.  There should only be
                  six institutions listed in the columns.  See the Editing
                  Supervisor if there is any confusion here concerning which
                  institution R regarded as #1, #2, etc.


A6          Edit "OTHER INSTITUTION TYPE" Questions.  If no box is checked in
            a column at A6, but instead the type is written in the "OTHER"
            box, edit the written response to category 11-14 or 16 if it is
            quite clear that the institution type in the written response is
            consistent with the type of institution in category 11-14 or 16.


A8          Check for Banks Less Than or Over 50 Miles Away.  If a distance of
            less than one or over 50 miles is written in the "MILES" blank in
            any column for A8, edit it out and check box 96 or 51.



               SECTION B:  ATTITUDES TOWARD CREDIT/CREDIT CARDS


B6-B10      CREDIT CARD GRID

            1.    If R does not know how many cards of a particular type other
                  family members have, or the balance on those cards, the
                  interviewer is instructed to make a marginal note.  Enter
                  this information on a Problem Sheet.

            2.    Edit out all credit cards in the name of a business
                  (including businesses that the PEU has an interest).  Do
                  not, however, edit out credit cards in R's or PEU members'
                  names but which may be used for business.

            3.    Check Column E credit card type.  If it is clear that a
                  credit card listed in COL E really belongs in one of the
                  other columns, edit the information into its proper
                  location.  Most commonly a store credit card will have been
                  entered here and should be edited to COL B.

                  a.  Telephone credit cards should be left, or included, in
                      COL E.



B6,B10      Check the Number of Financial Institutions against the Number of
COL A       Bank-Type Cards.  If there are more institutions checked at B10
            than the # of accounts entered at B6, see the Editing Supervisor.



                      SECTION D: HOUSING STATUS (D1-D22)


D1          1.    Check that the correct sequence was followed at interviewer
                  checkpoint.  Check ZZ2 and D16 to help in identifying
                  problems.

            2.    See farm guidelines, p. 24.


D4          Edit # acres to percent by dividing the # acres in D4 or D8 by the
            # acres in D2.  Round to two decimal points.  100% is allowable if
            given by R (even though R lives on part of it).


D5          OWNERSHIP STATUS OF FARM/RANCH

            1.    Check that R's who live on farms or ranches have gone
                  through the own/rent sequence appropriately.  Look for
                  marginal notes that explain any unusual situations, and
                  bring these to the attention of the supervisor if the
                  sequence marked does not appear to incorporate all
                  information.

            2.    If PEU are share croppers or tenant farmers:  A share
                  cropper does not own the farm but uses the farm and pays
                  rent in the form of a share of the crops to the owner.  A
                  tenant farmer rents his farm and pays rent in cash.  For
                  people in these classifications, make sure the "RENTS" box
                  is checked at D5.  Check the rent amount given at D17; if it
                  is given as a dollar amount, leave it as is.  If R "doesn't
                  know", edit it to 9,999,996.  In either case, write it on
                  the Problem Sheet if the rent, or part of the rent, is not
                  paid in money.

            3.    If the "OTHER" box at D5 is marked, examine the response to
                  see if it should be edited to boxes 1-4 only if the proper
                  skips have been followed.  If the response should remain in
                  the 'OTHER' box, write it on a Problem Sheet.


D5c         Edit as per D19 below.


D8          Edit the # ACRES to PERCENT as per D4.

                                                              January 12, 1990

                             FARM EDIT GUIDELINES


We have arrived at a set of guidelines for handling farms that we think will
be fairly clear in most cases.  The guidelines are:

For farm owners and operators:

      1.    All property of the farm, whether adjacent or not, as long as it
            is reported as a single business, will be included in the D
            section.  D2 should contain all the acreage of the farm; D5d (or
            D10) will contain the value of all the land of the farm that the
            PEU owns; and D20 should be the total cost of all the property of
            the farm.

      2.    Frequently farmland that is not adjacent to the land the home is
            located on is reported in section E.  Such property and any
            associated debt should be moved from the E section to the
            appropriate section D sequences.

      3.    The above assumes that the PEU actively manages a farming business
            that is reported in the M5-M18 sequence.  The amounts in M14, M15,
            and M18 will contain the following:

            M14         The total current value of all the farmland plus the
                        house and immediately surrounding land plus any tools,
                        implements, or stock.

            M15         The amount that was paid for all of the above.

            M18         The amount at M14 minus any debt on the farmland or
                        the farm business.

            In all cases these items will need to be checked by the Editing
            Supervisor.

For all cases that do not fit the situations outlined above, see the Editing
Supervisor.

D11,D11e   MOBILE HOMES:

            1.    Look for marginal notes that explain any unusual situations,
                  and bring these to the attention of the supervisor if the
                  sequence marked does not incorporate all relevant
                  information.  Write such cases on a Problem Sheet.

            2.    If "NEITHER OWNS NOR RENTS" is marked, examine the responses
                  to see if R owns any part of the site or mobile home.  If
                  so, edit D11 and follow-up questions appropriately to agree
                  with the information you have.  If there is any uncertainty
                  about how to code D11, see the Editing Supervisor.



D16-D16b    HOUSE/APARTMENT/FARMHOUSE OWNERSHIP STATUS:

            1.    Look for marginal notes that explain any unusual situations. 
                  If the sequence marked does not appear to incorporate all
                  information, bring these to the attention of the Editing
                  Supervisor.  Write up any problem cases on a Problem Sheet.

            2.    If R mentions Homeowners' Association at D16, edit it to 
                  '5. TOWNHOUSE ASSOC.'

                  a.    If notes make it clear that the fees are not paid or
                        that they are paid but are optional or for
                        recreational purposes only, edit D16 to OWNS OR IS
                        BUYING and edit D16a to ALL OTHERS.

                  b.    OTHERWISE, edit D16 to TOWNHOUSE ASSOC. and D16b to
                        the fees given (NA them if the amount is not given).

            3.    If the home is owned wholly or partly by a business owned by
                  the PEU (in Section M), see the Editing Supervisor.

            4.    If "R LIVES IN MULTIPLE HU STRUCTURE" is checked at D16a,
                  check the responses to D18 and D18a.  

            5.    If "NEITHER OWNS NOR RENTS" is checked, read the explanation
                  given at D16c and check that the correct sequence was taken. 
                  
                  a.    If it appears that R owns any part of his/her home,
                        edit D16 to "OWNS OR IS BUYING" and edit the follow-up
                        questions appropriately, using all the information
                        given.  If there is any uncertainty, see the Editing
                        Supervisor and write any problem cases on the Problem
                        Sheet.
                  b.    If R's housing is fully subsidized by the government,
                        including military personnel, edit D16 to "PAYS RENT".


                                  DEFINITIONS
            
            1.   NEITHER OWNS NOR RENTS are those who:                     
                                                                           
                 a.    receive rent as part of their pay                   
                                                                           
                 b.    have sold the house in which they live, have not    
                       moved out as yet, but pay no rent                   
                                                                           
                 c.    who receive housing as a gift from someone outside  
                       the HU.                                             
                                                                           
            2.   IF BOTH "OWNS" AND "RENTS" BOXES ARE CHECKED, a correction
                 must be made.  For example:                               
                                                                           
                 a.    when someone rents the dwelling they live in now,   
                       but owns a home somewhere else, it is the residence 
                       currently occupied that is wanted here, and they    
                       should be considered a renter.  The home they own   
                       is real estate which should be counted at E15.      
                                                                           
                 b.    If someone rents their home now but has built or    
                       bought, or is building, a home into which they are  
                       about to move, only the RENT box should be checked. 
                                                                           
            3.   WHEREVER R IS CURRENTLY LIVING IS WHAT SHOULD BE RECORDED.
                                                                           
                 If you find someone reporting on a residence which they   
                 are not currently living in, take it to the Editing       
                 Supervisor.  A Problem Sheet will have to be written up.  
            


D17-D17c   IF PEU PAYS RENT:

            1.    If R pays for both room and board, edit out the amount paid
                  for board.  If the amount paid is not known, assume half of
                  what is paid is rent.  If this seems unreasonable, see the
                  Editing Supervisor.

            2.    We want the rent most recently paid (or due).  For example,
                  if "the rent was just raised to $275, but when the rent was
                  paid last it was $260," edit it to $260 per month.  If R
                  mentions several different rents paid over the past year and
                  gives an average, edit to the rent last paid (or due).

            3.    If the rent is shared with other EU's, edit D17 to the PEU's
                  share only.  If several "Independent Adult" roommates share
                  the rent with R and the proportions are unknown, split the
                  total rent equally among them and edit D17 to R's share.  If
                  the situation is more complex, see the Editing Supervisor.

            4.    If all of R's rent is subsidized by a governmental unit,
                  edit D17 to '9 999 995' and NA D17a and D17b if they have
                  been left blank.  Check T1k&n to make sure that the value of
                  the subsidized rent is included in those income amounts.  If
                  it isn't, edit it at T1k or T1n as per instructions there.

            5.    FOR TENANT FARMERS & SHARECROPPERS -- see D5.


D17a        Water is not assumed to be a utility for purposes of D17a.  If
            "Yes, water" or "only water," edit the response to "NO" 


D17b        If only stove and/or refrigerator are provided, edit D17b to
            "UNFURNISHED" if it is not already so marked.


D17c        If R "lived here before," moved out and then moved back, edit D17c
            to date R moved back this time.  If R lived in another apartment
            in this building or project before moving to this apartment, edit
            D17c to date R moved to this apartment.


D18, D18a   Look for marginal notes here explaining any unusual situations. 
            If it is unclear how such information should be coded, see the
            Editing Supervisor.  Write it up on a Problem Sheet if there are
            any unusual or confusing situations.  Check ZZ2 for clarification.


D19         FOR HOME (FARM) OWNERS:

            1.    The house value at D19 should include the part R owns.  For
                  farmers this includes the house, farm buildings, and
                  contiguous farm land.

            2.    If R says they have been offered $80,000 but wouldn't take
                  less than $100,000, code the midpoint.

            3.    If R has been offered more than the actual value of the
                  property ("I've been offered $50,000, but it's actually
                  worth only $30,000"), code the amount offered.

            4.    If R mentions only the TAX assessed value edit it to 
                  "9,999,996" and put it and the tax assessed value on the
                  Problem Sheet.

            5.    If part of the house is owned by persons with independent
                  finances, the whole value of the house should be at D19-D22
                  as long as 100% of the house is owned by HU members.  
                  If others outside the HU own part of the house, only the
                  part owned by HU members should be in D19-D22.
                  The value of the HU's share should be at Y39b & Y39c as
                  well, if relevant.


D20         If R bought a house furnished, do not attempt to separate out the
            value of the furnishings.  


D21         DATE OF PURCHASE:

            1.    In cases where multiple dates are given at D21 (purchase
                  date, the house occupancy date, and/or the date of the
                  mortgage), edit in the date as per the following priorities:

                  
                  1st Priority:  The purchase (closing) date of the house
                                                                         
                  2nd Priority:  The date of the mortgage on the house   
                                                                         
                  3rd Priority:  The date moved in                       
                  

                  Record the uncoded dates on the Problem Sheet.  If the
                  purchase date of the land is given, edit it out.

            2.    If the house was purchased/inherited/built in increments,
                  edit it to the priorities above for the earliest increment
                  of the house itself (not incl. land purchases).

            3.    If farmers bought their farm in increments, use the date the
                  house was purchased/built.

            4.    If the house was inherited (the GIFT/INHERITANCE box at D20
                  is checked), this date should be the date inherited.


D22         Add land and house taxes together if they are given separately.
            If the period of taxes is not given, write in "YEAR."



               SECTION D: HOME MORTGAGES AND OTHER HOME LOANS
                                   (D23-D53)


D23         If R reports both "YES, MORTGAGE" and "YES, LAND CONTRACT" at D23,
            check the grid to make sure that at least two columns of the grid
            have been filled out.  If they have, edit D23 to "YES, MORTGAGE"
            and follow that sequence.
            If at least two columns of the mortgage grid have not been filled
            out, see the Editing Supervisor.


D27-D40a    THE MORTGAGE GRID

            1.    Be on the lookout for any unusual or confusing mortgage
                  arrangements which may be problems.  Take them to the
                  Editing Supervisor and, if necessary, write them up on the
                  Problem Sheet.

            2.    Mortgages reported in this grid should always be left in
                  unless it is clear:

                  a.    that it is not the home the PEU is currently living in
                        (move these debts to E15-E34, "Other Property");

                  b.    the home the PEU is currently living in is not
                        collateral for the mortgage (these may be moved to
                        D41-D51 or D54-D64) depending on the purpose of the
                        loan;

                  c.    the PEU is not liable for the mortgage.

                  d.    NOTE:  Another exception would be a HOME EQUITY LINE
                        OF CREDIT (see Quick Reference Guide for definition)
                        that was NOT a first mortgage.  These should be edited
                        out of COL B or C for D27-D40 or D41-D51 and moved to
                        D53-D53m.

                  In all these cases see the Editing Supervisor and the case
                  should be written up on the Problem Sheet.

            3.    If it is discovered that the PEU does not own any of the
                  home and are living rent-free, D16a will have to be edited
                  to NEITHER OWNS NOR RENTS, and Section D re-edited, UNLESS
                  the owner is an Independent Adult living in the HU.  Then
                  the full house value and mortgage should be left in and
                  edited as per item 2 for D28, D29, D31.  Be sure, in these
                  cases, that Y39a is "100%".  See the Editing Supervisor and
                  write this up on a Problem Sheet.

            4.    If it is found that the mortgage is partly or wholly assumed
                  or paid for by a business in Section M owned by the PEU, you
                  should see the Editing Supervisor.

            5.    If marginal notes indicate that the payments change during
                  the life of the mortgage for reasons other than variable
                  interest or balloon payments (which are handled by the
                  grid), see the Editing Supervisor and put it on the Problem
                  Sheet.  Examples of these would be "negative amortization"
                  or "graduated payments".

            6.    Co-ops may have mortgages on the entire building, as well as
                  on the PEU's unit.  If you encounter any such as these, edit
                  them to include only PEU's unit.


D27, D28,   In the case of assumed mortgages, the data in D27, D28, and D30
D30         should be as of the date that the mortgage was assumed by the PEU,
            not the date it was originally taken out by the seller.


D27a        Beware of confusions between "seller-provided" mortgages (where
            the seller provides the financing for the mortgage and the PEU
            pays the seller) and "assumed" mortgages where the PEU takes over
            the payments from the seller.  For "seller-provided" mortgages,
            D27a should be edited to "NO".


D28, D29   1.    If the PEU owns the house jointly with others outside the
D31               HU, D28, D29 and D31 should be edited to include only the
                  PEU's share.  If a split must be made, see the Editing
                  Supervisor.

            2.    If it is jointly owned with an Independent Adult living in
                  the HU, then the FULL mortgage should be in Section D.  Y39
                  should record the Independent Adult's percentage.  The FULL
                  value of the house should be included at both D19 and Y39b
                  and the FULL amount still owed on the mortgage should be
                  included at both D29 and Y39c.  In addition, in these cases,
                  the editor should check to insure that D20 includes the FULL
                  purchase price and D22 ALL of the real estate taxes on the
                  home.  NOTE:  The I'wer Instruction in parens following the
                  Q at D19 does not apply to these cases.

            3.    If D28, D29 and D31 are given for an entire building which
                  is only partly occupied by the PEU, they should be edited to
                  include only that part occupied.  In these cases you must
                  see the Editing Supervisor and write the case on the Problem
                  Sheet.


D29         If D29 is NA, do NOT compute it from D30 and D31; leave it blank.


D30         1.    If D30 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as
                  per the GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22a.

            2.    If "NO SET #" is checked, check D52-D53k for possible
                  double-counting.  If double-counting is found, see the
                  Editing Supervisor.


D36         Edit the Type of Institution at D36 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


D37         Precode the purpose of the 2nd mortgage at D37 using the LOAN
            PURPOSE CODE.


D40, D40a   Check that the D40 and D40a boxes are checked correctly after all
            editing of this section is finished.



D41-D51    OTHER HOME LOANS

            1.    Watch for cases here which have:

                  a.    HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT loans, which should be in
                        D53-D53m;

                  b.    2nd and 3rd Mortgages (for which the home is clearly
                        noted as being collateral) which should be in COLUMNS
                        B & C of the D27-D40 mortgage grid;

                  c.    Home improvement loans (purpose clearly stated), for
                        which the home is not collateral, should be in D54-
                        D64.

                  If you think you have found any of these, see the Editing
                  Supervisor.  They should be edited to their proper place. 
                  If you find such a loan here double-counted with one in D53-
                  D53m, the Section H loan grid, or D54-D64, edit it out here
                  and leave it in its proper place.  These should be written
                  on the Problem Sheet.

            2.    If more than one "other" loan is itemized here, leave the
                  largest (in terms of the amount borrowed) here and move any
                  other to the grid at H3-H15 (where they should be coded "01"
                  for loan purpose).


D45         If D45 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per the
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


D51         Edit the type of institution at D51 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


D53         Edit the # LINES OF CREDIT entered in the box at D53 to be
            consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 of the grid
            and D53m as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


D53a-D53h  THE HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT (HELC) GRID

            1.    If a HELC here is double counted in the Mortgage grid at
                  D27-D39, leave it in there if it is the first mortgage;
                  leave it in here if it is not a first mortgage; put it on a
                  Problem Sheet in either case.

            2.    Check for Credit Cards which may be included or double-
                  counted here.  They should be edited out of this sequence to
                  Section B.  If they are double counted, remove them from
                  Section B and put the information on a Problem Sheet.  If
                  they can't be separated out of Section B, see the Editing
                  Supervisor.

            3.    Edit out any business lines of credit found here.


D53d        Pre-code the purpose of the loan using the LOAN PURPOSE CODE 

            If the purpose of the loan is coded "10" (to purchase a car),
            check the "owned vehicle" grid (G8-G23) to see if this loan is
            double-counted there.

                  a.    If it clearly is, edit the debt out of the vehicle
                        grid.

                  b.    If it may be, but it is not clear, see the Editing
                        Supervisor.
                        NOTE:  A car used for business purposes (but not owned
                        by the business) may be left here.


D53h        Edit the type of institution at D53h as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION
            21.


D53m        If the PEU has more than three HELC, any money owed on these
            surplus lines will be entered at D53m.  If marginal notes should
            include more information on one or more of them than just the
            amount owed, move it to the loan grid at H1-H15, if there is an
            available empty column.  If the purpose of the loan is not
            specified, you will have to precode loan purpose NA.


            SECTION D: ADDITIONS AND REPAIRS AND LINES OF CREDIT
                                   (D54-D76)


D54-D54a    ADDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS

            1.    Check marginal notes to make sure R has not failed to
                  include an addition such as "landscaping", "built a garage",
                  or some other exterior addition which he/she thought should
                  not be included but which is an addition.  If you find such
                  cases, bring them to the Editing Supervisor.

            2.    Additions on farms and businesses should be edited out.  But
                  additions on the farmhouse, or that part of a business which
                  contains the PEU's home, should be left in.

            3.    If a home was built in increments and an addition seems to
                  be one or more of the increments, take it to the Editing
                  Supervisor.  Building of the home and its cost and loans
                  should not be here.


D55-D65     LOANS FOR ADDITIONS

            1.    If a loan here is clearly collateralized by the house, it
                  should be moved to column 2 or 3 in the mortgage grid.

            2.    If you find a loan here that is clearly a Home Equity Line
                  of Credit, it should be moved to D53-D53m.

            3.    Loans here that are double-counted in the mortgage or HELC
                  sections should be edited out here and left in those
                  sections.


D58         If D58 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per the
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


D64         Edit the type of institution at D64 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


D65-D65b    If another home addition and improvement loan is at D65-D65b and
            marginal notes provide more information on it than can be
            contained in D65a&b, move it to the loan grid at H1-H15, if there
            is an available column there.

            LINES OF CREDIT FOR NON-OWNERS ONLY:

D68c        Edit the type of institution at D68c as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION
            21--"CHECK ALL THAT APPLY".


D68d        Check that the # LINES OF CREDIT (LOC) recorded in the blank at
& D69       D68d is the same number as is entered in the box at D69 on the
            next page.  If it is not, see the Editing Supervisor.


D69         Edit the # LINES OF CREDIT (LOC) entered in the box at D69 to be
            consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 of the grid
            and D76 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


D70-D74     LINES OF CREDIT (LOC) GRID

            1.    Business lines of credit should not be included here.  Edit
                  any that are found out, with a note saying "business debt." 
                  If it is for a "Sole Proprietorship", see the Editing
                  Supervisor as per General Instruction 26.


D70         Precode the purpose of the loan using the LOAN PURPOSE CODE.  

            See the instructions for D53d if the purpose is code "10" (to
            purchase a car).


D74         Edit the type of institution at D74 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


D76         If there are more than three LOC, any money currently owed on the
            surplus LOC's will be in D76.  If enough detail is included in
            marginal notes concerning this debt, edit it out of D76 and into
            H1-H15 if there is an empty column.  The purpose of the loan will
            have to be NA'd if it is not given here.
                 SECTION E: OTHER PROPERTIES, LAND CONTRACTS


E2a         Edit the # NOTES/LAND CONTRACTS/MORTGAGES entered in the box at
            E2a to be consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 of
            the grid and E13-E13b as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


E3-E13b     NOTES/LAND CONTRACTS/MORTGAGES OWNED

            1.    Check for double-counting of properties between E3-E11
                  (sold) and E16-E34a (currently owned).  If a property is
                  clearly listed in both places, leave it here and edit it out
                  of E16-E34a.  If you suspect double-counting but it's not
                  clear, take it to the Editing Supervisor.

            2.    Edit out all notes, land contracts or mortgages held or
                  owned by any business that the PEU owns or has an interest
                  in.  


E9          If E9 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


E11a        If E11 is YES:  Check the amount the PEU still owes at E11a and
            the amount it is still owed at E4 or E7.  If the amount at E11a is
            considerably larger than the amount at E4 or E7, and there are
            marginal notes, write them on the Problem Sheet.


E15         Edit the # PROPERTIES entered in the box at E15 to be consistent
            with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 of the grid and E36-
            E37f, as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


E15-E37e    THE OTHER PROPERTY OWNED GRID

            1.    Do NOT edit out "any property owned by a business that [PEU]
                  has an interest in" as instructed by the question at E14,
                  unless it is perfectly clear that the property is included
                  or is the same as the business listed in Section M.  If you
                  suspect that it is, but it is not perfectly clear, see the
                  Editing Supervisor.  These will be flagged with a special
                  code (see PROPERTY LINK CODE below).

           2.    Do edit out properties owned by limited partnerships where R
                  is a limited partner if you find them in this section
                  (UNLESS R or the PEU member owning them are GENERAL
                  PARTNERS).  Edit them out of here (E16-E34a) AND edit them
                  into the M20-M21a section on passive businesses.  See the
                  Editing Supervisor for such cases and write them up on the
                  Problem Sheet.

            3.    Burial Plots, if listed here, should be moved to N52a-N52b. 
                  If there is any debt on them, move that to the Section H
                  loan grid.

            4.    Mobile Homes should be included here, unless they are the
                  current residence of the PEU.  (See definition at G8, note
                  3.)

            5.    Be particularly alert in this section for unusual or
                  confusing situations.  Take anything that seems suspicious
                  to the Editing Supervisor.


E16         Precode each property, using the PROPERTY LINK CODE, above the
            PROPERTY # heading for each column.  If you are unsure which code
            to use for a property, see the Editing Supervisor.


E17         1.    If "Limited Partnerships" are noted here, see E15-E37e, item
                  2 above.

            2.    Box 1 "OWNED BY R" is meant to include ownership by R's
                  Spouse, either with R or alone.


E17a-E33    Value and Debt on Property

            1.    If marginal notes indicate that only the PEU's share is
                  recorded in E18-E29, compute and edit E18, E20, E23, E24 and
                  E26 to the totals for the property using the PEU's share at
                  E17a.

            2.    If the PEU owns TIMESHARE property, then leave E18-E29 as
                  only the PEU's share and edit E17 to "OWNED JOINTLY".  If
                  the entire value and debt on TIMESHARE property is given,
                  compute and edit it to the PEU's share only.

            3.    Except for item 2 above, if E17a is NA or DK and it appears
                  that E18, E20, E23 and E24 are only the PEU's share, then NA
                  E18, E20, E23 and E24 and put this on the Problem Sheet.


E18         If "TAX ASSESSED" value is given, edit it out and precode 
            "9 999 996".  Write the tax assessed value with appropriate notes
            on the Problem Sheet.


E25         If E25 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22a.


E33         Edit the Type of Institution at E33 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


E34a,       Gross Income from Property
E36g,
E37f        1.    If there is any clear indication at E34a, E36b or E37f that
                  the income amount given is "net" (see definition in Quick
                  Reference Guide) instead of "gross", NA the amount and write
                  the details on the Problem Sheet.

            2.    If Income was received from the property other than RENTAL

            consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1, #2 and G6a as
            per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


G3-G6a      THE LEASED VEHICLE GRID

            1.    Move any vehicles which are leased by a business but used by
                  the PEU for personal purposes to G24.  These would include
                  those leased by a business that the PEU has an interest in. 
                  If the vehicle is leased by a business but not used by PEU
                  for personal purposes, then edit them out.

            2.    Edit out all leased motorhomes, travel trailers,
                  motorcycles, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles as well as

                  you are not sure whether the ones you are moving are already
                  included there, leave them out and record all details on the
                  Problem Sheet.  Those owned by a business but not used for
                  personal purposes should be edited out.

            2.    Edit tractors/mowers out.  If they are for personal use and
                  have debt, move debt to Section H.

            3.    Edit mobile homes to Section D and the mortgage grid if it
                  is the current residence of the PEU or to the Section E

                                  DEFINITION
                  
                  A mobile home is fixed to its lot.  A motorhome  has a 
                  motor and is self-propelled.  A travel trailer, for    
                  purposes of this study, is towed by a car and "parked",
                  when not being towed.  It is not fixed to its lot.  If 
                  it becomes fixed to its lot it should be considered a  
                  mobile home.  Be aware, however, that R's confuse these
                  terms and may not be using our definitions.            
                  


G16         If G16 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


G22         Edit the type of institution at G22 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


G23a-G23d   If there is more information about cars and the debt volunteered
            at G23a-G23d than can be captured in the Q's, write it on the
            Problem Sheet.


G24         Do not include vehicles leased by a business which the PEU uses
            regularly for personal purposes; write these on the Problem Sheet
            if found.


G25a        Edit the # (Other) VEHICLES box at G25a to be consistent with the
            number recorded in Columns #1, #2 and G39a-G39d in the OTHER
            VEHICLE GRID as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


G26-G39d    THE OTHER VEHICLE GRID

            Edit as per the Car Grid, G8-G23d, items 2a-d & 4 and G8, items 2
            & 3.


G32         If G32 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


G38         Edit the type of institution at G38 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


G39a-G39d   If there is more information on the vehicles in G39a-G39d
            volunteered than can be captured in the Q's, write it on the
            Problem Sheet.



                              SECTION H: LOANS


H1a-d       1.    In general, the number of loans recorded in H1a-d should sum
                  to the number recorded in the box at H3, except when 2 or
                  more smaller loans have been combined into one column to fit
                  into the grid and are counted as only one loan there.  In
                  that case, H1a-d will sum to the actual number of loans and
                  the box at H3 will reflect the number after being combined. 
                  If you edit loans into or out of the grid you must change
                  the numbers recorded in H1a-d, as well as the H3 control
                  box.

            2.    If it should be necessary to distinguish between the
                  categories of a-d, assume a and b have high priority and d
                  has low priority.


H3          Edit the # OF LOANS entered in the box at H3 to be consistent with
            the number recorded in Columns #1-#6 (including LOANS #4-#6 on the
            EXTRA LOAN PAGES), as well as the number of loans from the grid
            that were moved to N53a, as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.  (NOTE:
            Loans #5 and #6 may be misnumbered in the printing of the Iw on
            p.45b.)


H4-H15      THE (OTHER) LOAN GRID

            1.    EXCLUDE:

                  a.    Business or farm debt that the PEU is not personally
                        liable for.  If it is unclear whether the
                        business/farm or the PEU is liable, check M10-M10b. 
                        If it is still unclear, leave it in and write it on
                        the Problem Sheet.

                  b.    Past due bills, UNLESS:

                        1)    a specific repayment arrangement has been made;
                              or

                        2)    the bill is more than 3 months past due; or

                        3)    it amounts to $200 or more.

                  c.    Debts which R clearly has no intention of repaying.

                  d.    Credit card debt (this should be edited to Section B).

                  e.    Intra-PEU debt (i.e., owed by one PEU member to
                        another PEU member).

            2.    INCLUDE:

                  a.    Back taxes.

                  b.    Money borrowed from a pension plan.

                  c.    Medical debt (of $200 or more).

                  d.    Loans for home improvements which R listed here
                        (unless it is double-counted at D55-D65b, then it
                        should be left there only).

                  e.    Education loans, whether currently being paid on or
                        not (if it is owed by a current member of the PEU).

                  f.    Defaulted co-signed notes: loans which a PEU member
                        had co-signed for someone else and for which the PEU
                        member now assumes the obligation.  These must also be
                        written on the Problem Sheet.

                  g.    Intra-HU debt: debt that a PEU member owes to an
                        Independent Adult living in the HU.

                  h.    All other debts or loans owed by a member of the PEU
                        listed by R in this section and not edited out or
                        moved by any of the other instructions here, or found
                        anywhere else in the interview and not excluded by any
                        instructions here.


H4          Code the purpose of the loan at H4 using the LOAN PURPOSE CODE.

            97 if more than two mentions are given.


H5         1.    For REGULAR INSTALLMENT loans (H7=1), if marginal notes
                  indicate that the date that the loan was taken out is
                  different than when the payments started, edit H5 to the
                  date the payments started.  If it is known that the date is
                  different, but it is not known the date they started, write
                  it on the Problem Sheet.

            2.    If payments haven't started yet, but date is known when they
                  will start, edit H5 to that date.


H7          1.    H7 should be edited to "REGULAR PAYMENTS" in all cases in
                  which current regular monthly payments have been agreed
                  upon, including overdue bills which the PEU has made
                  "arrangements" for.

            2.    H7 should be edited to "OTHER KIND" for:

                  a.    loans not yet due or not yet being paid on (such as
                        Educational Loans on which payments won't start until
                        sometime in the future);

                  b.    past due bills on which no "arrangements" have been
                        made;

                        monthly (i.e., "twice a month," "quarterly").  
                        NOTE:  In these cases, payments, and the frequency of
                        them, should be edited to H10.  You will have to NA
                        H11 & H12 UNLESS R volunteered them.

H8          If H8 is answered in a fractional # of years, edit it as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 22.


H9          For regular installment loans where payments are not currently
            being made, edit H9 to '9995.  No payment being made.'  If they
            are behind or not paying the full payment amount, edit H9 to the
            amount they should pay and put other information on a Problem
            Sheet.


H10         For loans and debts on which payments are not yet being made (such
            as deferred education loans), edit the "typical payment" to $"0"
            PER ___.


H13         If the current interest rate for medical bills owed to doctors,
            dentists and medical facilities is NA or DK, leave it NA/DK.


H14         1.    Edit the type of institution at H14 as per GENERAL

            -7.  Other (incl. combinations)


                            SECTION M:  BUSINESSES


M1, M2      Check D1; if "R LIVES ON A RANCH AND FARM" is checked AND D3 is
            checked "YES", then box "R OR R"S FAMILY OPERATE FARM/RANCH
            BUSINESS ON THEIR PROPERTY" should be checked at M1 and there
            should be at least one business at M2 connected to the farm or
            ranch.  If not, bring the Interview to the Editing Supervisor.


M2, M4a,    Edit the number entered in "# BUSINESSES" at M4a to be
M5          consistent with the number entered in the control box at M5.


M5          Edit the # OF BUSINESSES entered in the box at M5 to be consistent
            with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 and M19a-c of the grid.


M6          If more than one box is checked or marginal notes are inconsistent
            with the box checked at M6, edit the boxes to one choice to
            indicate how the PEU originally acquired the business.  

            If necessary, edit the date at M8 to agree with the editing of M6.


M9d         If R reports that a business is a "limited partnership" at M9d, it
            should be moved to M20-M20e (PASSIVE BUSINESSES), but only if it
            is clearly stated that they (the PEU) are "limited partners" and
            not general partners.

            If the limited partnership is moved to M20-M20e, all the details
            of the business should be written on the Problem Sheet and, if it
            is the only business, M4 should be edited to "NO".


M10, M10a   CHECK FOR CURRENT COLLATERALIZED LOAN

            1.    If M10 has been marked YES, but the answer to M10a indicates
                  that R does not currently have a personal loan (i.e., M10a
                  is "nothing"), edit M10 to NO.


M14, M15          Edit to include only PEU's share.

M16, M17          If the net income reported in M17 exceeds the gross receipts
                  reported in M16, leave the inconsistency unless there are
                  explanatory notes which support reversing the figures at M16
                  & M17.  If any explanatory information is available, write
                  it on the Problem Sheet.


M20a,       Check the number of other (non-actively managed) businesses
M21a-f      reported at M20a.  It should be equal to or greater than the
            number of types of businesses ("YES" boxes) checked for M21a-f. 
            See the Editing Supervisor if it is not.



                         SECTION N: FINANCIAL ASSETS


N1-N43a     GENERAL SECTION N INSTRUCTIONS

            1.    Watch for accounts and assets that belong wholly or partly
                  to a business or to persons not in the PEU.

                  a.    If they belong wholly to the business or person
                        outside the HU, edit them out unless the business is a
                        "sole proprietorship", in which case see the Editing
                        Supervisor.  

                  b.    If they belong to an INDEPENDENT ADULT, check to make
                        sure they are included at Y37-Y38c.

                  c.    If they are owned jointly with the PEU, and it is not
                        clear how to split them, leave them in, but NA the
                        amount.  Write these on the Problem Sheet.

            2.    Watch for margin notes or specific $ amounts reoccurring in
                  different places which would indicate the double-counting of
                  assets within Section N.

                  Amounts double-counted in two different places in Section N
                  should be left in the most specific type of account, unless
                  otherwise instructed (e.g., if listed in a savings account
                  and as an IRA--edit it out of the savings account and leave
                  it in the IRA).  

            3.    Assets from pension and profit sharing plans may be held in
                  a variety of ways and could be double counted in both
                  Section N and Sections R/S.  Check assets and accounts in
                  this section against pension accounts for current jobs at
                  R21, R32, S21 and S32 and against pension accounts from past
                  jobs at R53c-d and S53c-d.  If double counting is found,
                  edit it out of Section N and leave it in Sections R/S,
                  except for IRA's which may be left in the R53b-g future
                  pension grid and the N11-N14 IRA grid if R53d is marked
                  "YES, IRA/KEOGH".

                  If assets are found in this section (N) which are clearly
                  labelled as being part of R's or S's current or future
                  pension or profit-sharing plans and which are not double-
                  counted in Sections R or S, see the Editing Supervisor.  For
                  SEP-IRAs, see Note 2 at N12.

           4.     Check for instances where a R has not known total figures
                  because they did not know a component -- possibly because an
                  account belongs to another FU member (for example, R may not
                  know the amount of a daughter's U.S. Government bonds, but
                  does know the amount of his/her own bonds).  In these cases,
                  NA the amount and write the known, given amount on the
                  Problem Sheet, as well as noting there that there is also an
                  unknown amount.

            5.    Edit out any accounts that were not set-up at the time of
                  the first contact for the Interview. 

            6.    Be sure that accounts which are jointly held by two people
                  in the PEU are only counted once.

            7.    If margin notes anywhere in Section N, except at N41-N46,
                  indicate that the assets listed are part of a CMA or FMA,
                  take it to the Editing Supervisor.


N3          Edit the # of Checking ACCOUNTS entered in the box at N3 to be
            consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-#6 of the
            Checking Account Grid and N8 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


            THE CHECKING ACCOUNT GRID

N4          Edit the type of institution at N4 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


N6          Check all accounts checked "YES" at N6 against the money market
            grid at N17-N20 for double-counting.  If any of them are clearly
            double-counted, edit them out of the checking account grid and
            leave them in the money market grid.  NOTE:  If that would edit
            all of the PEU checking accounts out, leave the first one listed
            in, and edit its counterpart out of the money market grid.  
            NEVER edit the main checking account (account #1) out of the
            checking account grid.  See the Editing Supervisor in such cases.


N8          If more detail is given concerning the remaining checking accounts
            than is asked for at N8, enter it on the Problem Sheet.


N10-N14    THE IRA, KEOGH ACCOUNT GRID

            1.    Watch particularly for double-counting here with pension
                  plans as per instruction 3 at the beginning of this section.

            2.    However, if a SEP-IRA (Simplified Employee Pension) is
                  listed here and is not double-counted in Sections R or S,
                  leave it in this grid and precode a "2" under the "IRA" box
                  at N12.


N11, N13          Edit the type of institution at N13 as per GENERAL
                  INSTRUCTION 21 -- "CHECK ALL THAT APPLY".


N14a        Be sure the correct skips are marked at the bottom of each column. 
            (This grid is not filled in sequentially, but in order of who has
            an IRA/KEOGH account.)


            THE MONEY MARKET GRID

N16a        Edit the # OF MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS entered in the box at N16a to
            agree with the number recorded in Columns #1-#3 and N21a as per
            GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


N19         Edit the type of institution at N19 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


N21a        If more detail is given concerning the remaining money market
            accounts than is asked for at N21a, enter it on the Problem Sheet.


N22-N22c          CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT

            1.    Be particularly alert to double-counting with IRA's at N11-
                  N14; edit them out of here if such double-counting is found.

            2.    Watch for double-counting also with Sections R/S.  See
                  GENERAL SECTION N INSTRUCTIONS item 3 if you find any.


N22a,       Edit the type of institution at N22c as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION
N22c        21--"CHECK ALL THAT APPLY".


N23a        Edit the # of Savings ACCOUNTS entered in the box at N23a to agree
            with the number of savings accounts recorded in Columns #1-#5 and
            N26a as per GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 24.


N24-N25     THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRID

            1.    This grid is intended to pick up any other savings-type
                  accounts that have not been included in earlier grids.  

                  Watch for double-counting with checking account, IRA, CD and
                  Money Market grids; edit them out of here if found.  Move
                  any such assets to their proper grids if they are found
                  clearly marked here and not there.

            2.    Include here passbook, statement savings and credit union
                  share accounts, Christmas Clubs and all other savings
                  accounts, as well as accounts at foreign banks, unions, AARP
                  or other organizations, building and loan associations, and
                  colleges.  


N24         Edit the type of institution at N24 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 21.


N26a        If more detail is given concerning the remaining savings accounts
            than is asked for at N26a, enter it on the Problem Sheet.


N28a-e      MUTUAL FUND GRID

            1.    Watch for double-counting of mutual funds with pension funds
                  in Sections R & S as per instruction 3 for this section.

            2.    Check for double-counting of:

                  a.    STOCK FUNDS at N28a and stock at N37 & N39, and

                  b.    BOND FUNDS at N28b-d and bonds at N31a, N32a or 
                        N33a-d.

                  If any are found, leave them here at N28a-d and edit them
                  out of the later section(s).


           BONDS AND BILLS

N32         Check that the number entered in the # BONDS OR BILLS blank is not
            less than the number of boxes checked "YES" at N33a-N33d.


N33a-d      Watch for double-counting of bonds with pension funds in Sections
            R & S as per instruction 3 for this section.


            PUBLICLY TRADED STOCK

N37, N39    1.    Watch for double-counting with pension or profit
                  sharing funds in Sections R & S as per instruction 3
                  for this section.

            2.    Check for consistency between N37 & N39a if N39 is "YES".

                  a.    N39a must be equal to or less than N37.

                  b.    If N36 is "1", then N37 and N39a must be the same.

                  If either of the above is not true, see the Editing
                  Supervisor.

            3.    If there is any indication that the amount of N39a includes
                  stock in a business in Section M, see the Editing
                  Supervisor.

            4.    Stock which is clearly not publicly traded and can be
                  separated from publicly traded stock should be moved to 
                  N52--"other assets."  You should check Section M for double-
                  counting.

            5.    IF R DOES NOT GIVE A VALUE ON STOCKS, but names the stock
                  and the number of shares or the dividends paid, record it on
                  the STOCK HELD sheet at the front of the Problem Sheet book.


            BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS

N40a-N40f   If any significant extra detail (not codeable in N40a-f) regarding
            a brokerage account (such as the amount due on a margin account)
            is volunteered by R, add it to the Problem Sheet.


N41-N46    TRUSTS, ANNUITIES, AND MANAGED INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS

            1.    Check the margin notes in this sequence for any indication
                  that the assets recorded are double-counted in any of the
                  accounts reported earlier in this section.  If you find any,
                  see the Editing Supervisor.

            2.    If R mentions a "limited time annuity" and any details are
                  given in margin notes, add them to the Problem Sheet.


            LIFE INSURANCE

N47-N50     Exclude life insurance policies whose beneficiary is a business in
            Section M.


N48, N48a   If "burial insurance" is mentioned at N48-N48a, leave it.



N51, N51a   MONEY OWED TO THE PEU

            1.    Exclude:

                  a.    money owed to a PEU business;

                  b.    money owed to one PEU member by another PEU member

                  c.    money that R doesn't expect to be repaid, including
                        "probably won't."

            2.    If at N51 a note says the PEU is owed money by a business in
                  Section M, check M11-M11a to determine if it is included
                  there:

                  a.    if it is, edit it out of here (N51-N51a).

                  b.    if it is not, move it to M11-M11a.

                  c.    if you are unsure about the double-counting, take it
                        to the Editing Supervisor.

            3.    Money owed to the PEU by a business that has been sold
                  should be left here.



N52-N52c          OTHER ASSETS

            1.    Move items that should be included in other sections to
                  their appropriate place.  If you have doubts concerning
                  whether or not to move something, see the Editing
                  Supervisor.

                  a.    Move any vehicles found here (including antique and
                        valuable vehicles) to Section G.  Assume that there is
                        no debt on them unless there is contrary evidence. 
                        Code [such] vehicles moved to the G8-G22 grid '6' at
                        G8.

            2.    Some items which should be included here:

                  a.    antique and valuable items and collections

                  b.    silver, gold, jewelry

                  c.    cash

            3.    Do not edit items out just because the value seems small.

            4.    Move any future inheritances or estates mentioned here to X9
                  and delete them from here.


N53-N53a          OTHER DEBTS

            1.    Edit out any debts which have been listed in other sections.

            2.    Move all bills of $200 or more whose purpose is clear to the
                  Section H loan grid if they meet the qualifications there.

            3.    Debts for business purposes should be moved to the Section H
                  loan grid if is clear that the PEU is personally liable.  (A
                  bankruptcy debt for an unincorporated business or debt on a
                  business no longer in operation would be examples.)

                  dates are given at R1d, edit R1d to the date which is
                  consistent with the green two-digit occupation status code. 
                  "50" is "RETIRED"; "52" is "DISABLED."

            2.    If R has retired twice (2 dates are given), keep only the
                  most recent date.  Put the other date on a Problem Sheet. 
                  This will occur often with career military persons who go on
                  to second careers.


R2          CHECK SELF-EMPLOYMENT

            1.    If the "RUN MY OWN BUSINESS" box at R2 is checked, edit R2
                  to "SELF-EMPLOYED."  

            2.    Make sure no self-employed persons followed the "SOMEONE
                  ELSE" sequence.  If they did, move the information in R3-R12
                  to the appropriate matching questions at R14-R14k.  R8
                  should be moved to R14g and R15 to R14k.  

            3.    If you are unsure whether you should consider someone "SELF-
                  EMPLOYED," see the Editing Supervisor.

            NOTE:  A person does not need to have a business listed in Section
            M to be self-employed.  Not all self-employed people own
            businesses.


R3, R4      MAIN OCCUPATION:  R WORKS FOR SOMEONE ELSE

            1.    Check that there is a three-digit green precode to the left
                  of R3 and R5.  If either is missing, see an occupation coder
                  or the Editing Supervisor.
            2.    If R's response to R3 and R4 seems to include two different
                  jobs, one of them should have been moved to R's second job
                  at R40-R44.  Check in these cases to see that a second job
                  is at R40-R44; if it is not, see an occupation coder or the
                  Editing Supervisor.

            3.    Precode the JOB/BUSINESS LINK CODE, for the job coded at R3,
                  to the right of the "I RUN MY OWN BUSINESS' box at R2.


R7          EDIT WEEKS WORKED

            1.    Edit any non-week response to # of WEEKS normally worked,
                  assuming 4.3 weeks to a month.

            2.    For teachers and other school personnel:

                  a.    Do not edit teachers or "school personnel" to 52 weeks
                        worked, if the answer is less.

                  b.    Check that the salary reported at R8 is consistent
                        with the # WEEKS R reported at R7.  If not, edit the
                        salary to an annual basis.

            3.    Note that Q reads "...in a normal year."  If R answers that
                  he/she hasn't worked for a full year yet and it is
                  reasonably clear that the job is not seasonal, edit R7 to 52
                  weeks.


R8          EDIT HOURLY JOB EARNINGS TO A WEEKLY WAGE

            1.    Edit dollars per hour at R8 to dollars per week by
                  multiplying the dollars per hour times the number of hours
                  per weeks worked given at R6 and then precode an "8" in the
                  PER blank, to indicate that this conversion was performed.

                  NOTE: If R6 is NA or DK, check R44 and assume the following:
                        
                        For females:  full-time = 35 hrs/wk, 5 days;
                                      part-time = 15 hrs/wk, 3 days.
                                                                    
                        For males:    full-time = 40 hrs/wk; 5 days;
                                      part-time = 20 hrs/wk, 4 days.
                        

            2.    Tips, bonuses, overtime, commissions and piecework should be
                  included in calculating the wage rate.

                  a.    If tips are mentioned, but the amount is NA, multiply
                        the wage rate by 1.5 and put the information on a
                        Problem Sheet.

                  b.    If overtime is mentioned, but the amount is NA, assume
                        time-and-a-half for any hours per week over 40 and put
                        the information on a Problem Sheet.

                  c.    If salary/wages are given for one time period and
                        commissions, bonuses, tips or other payments are given
                        for a different time period, see the Editing
                        Supervisor.
                  
                  d.    If R is paid by commission and the amount is not
                        known, edit R8 to the known amount and put all details
                        on the Problem Sheet.

                  e.    If the base wage rate is given or can be calculated,
                        do not NA it because of unknown or uncalculable tips,
                        bonuses, overtime, commissions or incentivesm etc.;
                        edit R8 to the known base wage rate and write the
                        uncoded details on the Problem Sheet.

            3.    If the salary/wages are given "after taxes", NA R8 and
                  record the details on the Problem Sheet.

            4.    If R says he/she isn't paid:

                  a.    If R does volunteer work (such as with United Way,
                        church work, etc.), take it to the Editing Supervisor
                        and put it on a Problem Sheet if R works more than 35
                        hrs/week.

                  b.    For those whose income is "paid in kind", include the
                        value of the "in kind payment" in or as their wage
                        (e.g., someone who manages an apartment building and
                        receives their own rent free as their wage earns the
                        value of their rent).

                  c.    Whenever the marginal notes or amounts for the above
                        are unclear, write the information on the Problem
                        Sheet.


R10        EDIT "SINCE" TO "# YEARS"

            1.    If R reports R10 as being "SINCE" a specific year, edit it
                  to the number of years since that specific year by
                  subtracting it from the date of the Interview ('89 or '90--
                  see facesheet).  Enter that calculation into the # YEARS
                  blank (i.e., if "SINCE 1960" and the Interview date is 1989,
                  edit out "1960" and edit "29" into # OF YEARS).

            2.    If R gives dates and there was a break in service, edit the
                  total number of years, not including the break, into the #
                  YEARS blank.


R11         EDIT "UNTIL AGE" TO "# YEARS"

            1.    If R answers R11 as being "UNTIL AGE ___", edit to "___ #
                  YEARS" by subtracting R's inputed age (from the IMPUT AGE
                  for R on the facesheet) from the AGE given here.  Enter this
                  calculation into the "# YEARS" blank and edit the response
                  in the "UNTIL AGE" blank out.

            2.    For reasponses like "until I can't work any longer", "as
                  long as I can", "indefinitely", mark the "NEVER STOP" box.


R14, R14a   MAIN OCCUPATION:  SELF-EMPLOYED

            1.    Check that the three digit occupation and industry codes are
                  precoded to the left of R14 and R14a.  See an occupation
                  coder or the Editing Supervisor if they are missing.

            2.    If R's response to R14 and R14a seems to be two different
                  jobs, edit as per instruction 2 for R3, R4.

            3.    Precode the JOB/BUSINESS LINK CODE to the right of the small
                  box to the right of R14.  Make sure the box is checked if
                  the job is linked to a business in Section M.


R14b        Edit "SINCE" to "# YEARS" as per R10.


R14c        Edit "UNTIL AGE" to "# YEARS" as per R11.


R14e        Edit R14e as per instructions for R7.

R14f        Edit R14f using all information available.  If it is not clear
            which box should be checked, see the Editing Supervisor.


R14g or h   1.    Edit hourly wages given at R14g or h to a dollar per week
                  amount as per instructions at R8.

            2.    For those who work in a family business or farm without
                  wages, edit R14h to '0' per 'WK'.


R17a        IF RECEIVING BENEFITS

            1.    If R17a is "YES", check R51c (pp. 98-99) to verify that
                  "CURR JOB PENS" is checked, for at least one column, for
                  this R.  (NOTE: RECIPIENT is found checked at the top of the
                  column).

            2.    If R17a is "NO", check that the # PLANS entered in R17
                  agrees exactly with the # OF PLANS entered in the box at
                  R18.  If they do not, see the Editing Supervisor.


R17b        If R17b is "YES", check that the # PLANS--NOT YET RECEIVING
            BENEFITS at R17c agrees exactly with the # OF PLANS entered in the
            box at R18.  If they do not, see the Editing Supervisor.


R18         Edit the # OF Pension or Retirement PLANS entered in the box at
            R18 to be consistent with the number of plans recorded in Columns
            #1-#3 and R39-R39a as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


R21         Double-check that amounts at R21 are not double-counted in Section
            N.  If they are, edit them out of Section N.


R23         If "Employer Contributions" are mentioned, write this on the
            Problem Sheet.


R24         1.    If R answers R24 as "IN ___ YEARS", edit it to "AT AGE ___"
                  by adding the number of YEARS given to R's imputed age (from
                  the IMPUT AGE box, for R, on the facesheet).  Enter that
                  calculation into the "AT AGE" blank and edit the response
                  out of the "IN ___ YEARS" blank.

            2.    If R answers with a range, edit it to the midpoint and
                  record the range on a Problem Sheet.


R26         If more than one box is checked, priority code the lowest number
            and the benefit amount at R26a, consistently if possible.


R26a        Convert any annual payments to monthly payments.


R30a, R31a  Check these questions for complex responses (e.g., "match 2% and
            then 1/2 of next 4%).  If you find one, take it to the Editing
            Supervisor and put it on the Problem Sheet.


R32         Double-check N14 (p.63), N20 (p.64), N25 (p.66) and N28a-e (p.68)
            to make sure the amounts mentioned here at R32 are not double-
            counted there.  If they are, edit them out of the location in
            Section N and leave them here in Section R.


R36         Check for write-in responses at R36.

            1.    If "I wouldn't get anything until I retire," check the
                  "OTHER" box and NA the "PERCENT" at R36a.

            2.    If "It would roll over into another account," check the
                  "NONE" box, unless marginal notes indicate this is not true.

 
R39a        If anything is entered in R39a, enter it on the Problem Sheet.


R40-R43     SECOND (OTHER) JOB

            1.    If R works for a business reported in Section M (see M9a &
                  b) in addition to his main job and R does not report a
                  second job here, you should edit it in.  Do not edit in a
                  second job only on the basis of the "R/S" box being checked
                  at M9b.  (If this has been done by an OCC coder, see Editing
                  Supervisor.)


R40b        Precode the JOB/BUSINESS LINK CODE to the right of the smaller box
            within the larger box around R40b.


R41-R43     If it is necessary to edit in R's second job at R40-R40b and it is
            clear that R has already included all of his HOURS, WEEKS and
            INCOME for this job in R6-R8 with his main job and it is unclear
            how to separate them you should leave them in R6-R8 and code R41-
            R43 "0", unless the job being edited in is Military Reserve or
            National Guard.  In that case, see R41, R42 below.


R41,R42     If R's second job is the Military Reserve or the National Guard
            and R41 (# HOURS) and R42 (# WEEKS) are NA or DK, assume 20 hours
            per week for 13 weeks.


R43         EDIT SECOND JOB EARNINGS

            1.    Edit any dollars per hour responses at R43 to dollars per
                  week using the hours given at R41.

            2.    Edit other responses to R43 as per R8.

            3.    In addition, edit the following cases to $"0" per week if
                  their earnings are NA:

                  a.    Wives who work on the family farm or in the family
                        business but who haven't reported it as their main job
                        and report no second job.  (For wives who do report it
                        as a job, but without pay--see note 4b at R8.)

                  b.    Those cases specified for R41-R43 above.


            WORK HISTORY--FULL TIME NOW

R45d & e    Check that three-digit OCC and IND codes have been precoded
            to the left of R45d & e.


R45f & g    1.    Edit "YEARS AGO" to "19___" by subtracting the number
                  of "years ago" given from the year of the Interview
                  ('89 or '90, from item 3 on facesheet).  Edit the
                  calculation into the "YEARS AGO" blank and edit the
                  year out of the "19___" blank.

            2.    If there was a break in service between the 'START' date at
                  R45f and the 'STOP' date at R45g, write the break details on
                  the Problem Sheet.

            
R45h        Convert $ per hour to $ per week and edit other problems of job
            earnings as per instructions for R8.


R45m,       1.    Edit "AT AGE ___" to "IN ___ YEARS" by subtracting R's
R45p              imputed age (from the facesheet) from the age entered in "AT
                  AGE" and editing the result into the "IN ___ YEARS" blank. 
                  Edit out the response left in the "AT AGE" blank.

            2.    If R answers with a range, edit it to the midpoint and
                  record the range on a Problem Sheet.

            3.    The intention of the question is to find when R plans to
                  stop working full-time for good.  If R answers that he/she
                  plans to stop, but then start again at a later date, NA the
                  response or edit it to the data consistent with the intent
                  of the question, if that is known.

            1.    If R49 is checked "R. IS MARRIED/LIVING WITH PARTNER" then:

                  a.    R should have "M" or "P" circled in column D of the
                        HHL or a "7" or "8" should be precoded there AND

                  b.    there should be a SPOUSE BOOKLET included in the
                        Interview.  (If COL D of the HHL box is precoded "7"
                        or "8" and the SPOUSE BOOKLET is missing--see the
                        instruction for COL D in the HHL box section.

                  c.    If the S booklet is missing, see the Editing
                        Supervisor.

            2.    If R49 is checked "ALL OTHERS" then R will not have "M" or
                  "P" circled nor have "7" or "8" precoded in COL D of the HHL
                  box nor should a SPOUSE BOOKLET be included with the
                  Interview.

                  a.    If a SPOUSE BOOKLET is included in this case, see the
                        Editing Supervisor and then print "DO NOT CODE" in
                        large letters across the cover of the booklet.


S1-S49      Edit the SPOUSE BOOKLET as per R1-R47u above.  All Q #s in the
            SPOUSE BOOKLET correspond to the Qs in the R Section except that
            they are prefixed with an "S" rather than an "R". 


R50d-R50f   SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS

            1.    Edit out all non-Social Security payments; if in doubt, see
                  the Editing Supervisor.

            2.    Edit out SSI payments (Supplemental Security Income) and if
                  it was received in 1988, check T1k & T2k to make sure it is
                  included there.

            3.    Edit out all Social Security benefits for anyone except the
                  Respondent and the Spouse/Partner (however, make sure they
                  are included at T2m before you do).

            4.    "SURVIVORS BENEFITS":

                  a.    if they are for a widowed person 62 or over, leave
                        them here and edit R50d "RETIRE";

                  b.    Otherwise, leave as it is.

            5.    If Social Security benefits for minor HH children are being
                  received (e.g., disability), include the amount with the
                  payment of the adult who is receiving them.


R50d        If both "RETIRE" and "DISAB" are checked, and there are no notes
            to explain why:

            1.    If the person is 62 years old or older, edit to "RETIRE".

            2.    If under 62, edit to "DISAB".


R50e        Edit "SINCE" to "# YEARS" for both columns as per instructions at
            R10.


R50f        1.    Check that R50f (S.S. benefits being received) is not
                  double-counted at R51e (other benefits being received) or at
                  R53g (benefits expected to be received in the future).  If
                  any are, edit them out of the Inap.propriate place.  

                  NOTE:  Benefits for which no payment has yet been received
                  are expected benefits.

            2.    If a single amount is given for both R & S, and is based all
                  or mostly on the earnings of one individual, split the
                  amount and allocate 2/3 to the primary wage earner and 1/3
                  to the other person.


R51a        1.    Edit the # PENSIONS/DISABILITY PAYMENTS entered in the box
                  at R51a to agree with the number recorded in columns 1-6
                  (FIRST BENEFIT-SIXTH BENEFIT) as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


R51c        If "CURR JOB PENS" is checked in any column, after ascertaining
            the RECIPIENT from the top of the column:

            1.    Check the Recipient's job status at R1-R6 or S1-S6 to verify
                  they have a current job.

            2.    Check R17a or S17a to verify that they reported that they
                  are receiving benefits from it.

            3.    If information is inconsistent, see the Editing Supervisor.

            4.    Delete SSI if reported here.  If it was received in 1988,
                  check T1k and T2k to make sure it is included there.


R51d        Edit "SINCE" to "# YEARS" for each column as per R10.


R52a        Edit the # CASH SETTLEMENTS entered in the box at R52a to be
            consistent with the number recorded in Rows #1-#5.


R52b-R52d   CASH SETTLEMENT GRID

            Cash settlements may match assets reported elsewhere, especially
            in Section N.  Leave any double reporting, since the question is
            concerned only with the source of the asset.

R53f        Edit "IN ___ YRS" to "AT AGE" for all columns as per R24.


                              SECTION T:  INCOME

T1-T7d      GENERAL SECTION INSTRUCTIONS

            1.    Section T should contain the 1988 income of all of the
                  current PEU, i.e., the PEU members who are included in the
                  HHL box.  This may be a problem for recently married,
                  divorced, or separated Rs.  Edit out any income clearly not
                  belonging to the current PEU and bring to the Editing
                  Supervisor any unclear cases or cases where 1988 income of a
                  current PEU member has been left out.

                  NOTE:  If a deceased spouse was in the Household during
                  1988, include his/her income.

            2.    If income of a financially independent household member is
                  reported in Section T, it should be moved to Section Y, if
                  it is not already included there.

            3.    Do not force consistency between this section (T) and any of
                  the other sections of the Interview unless specifically
                  directed to by these instructions or unless important 1988
                  income information will not be reported anywhere else in the
                  Interview.  Thus, for example, if R reports an income amount
                  at E34a (where income from property is asked for), but does
                  not report any income at T1g, you should not change T1g. 
                  However, if R mentions an income component in a margin note
                  somewhere in the Interview which will not be coded anywhere
                  else, edit it in to T2a-n if it is not there.  In all cases,
                  check with the Editing Supervisor before editing any income
                  into the T section.


T1a-T1n     Check consistency between T1 and T2 for income components a-n.
T2a-T2n
            1.    If T1 is checked "NO" or left blank and an amount is entered
                  in T2, edit T1 to "YES", unless it is clear that the
                  Interviewer checked the wrong box or entered the amount in
                  the wrong place.

            2.    If T1 is checked "YES" but T2 is left blank, NA T2, unless
                  there is some indication what the amount should be (e.g., "I
                  already told you that").

           3.    Otherwise, the boxes at T1 should not be changed, unless
                  specifically directed to by these instructions or the
                  Editing Supervisor, even if T1 is checked "NO" but you know
                  from evidence in other sections of the Interview that the
                  PEU had income from this source (e.g., an amount is reported
                  at E34a but T1g is checked "NO").

            4.    Losses are only expected to appear at T2b, T2f, T2g, and
                  T2n.  Mark all losses clearly with parentheses.  If losses
                  are reported at any other location, see the Editing
                  Supervisor.


T2a-T2n     1988 INCOME COMPONENTS

            1.    Edit all non-yearly amounts in T2a-T2n to annual amounts for
                  1988.  Use all information given in margin notes and, in the
                  absence of other evidence, assume 12 months, 52 weeks and 26
                  bi-weekly periods in a year and 4.3 weeks in a month.

            2.    Pre-code the # of refusals, at the bottom of p.102, prefixed
                  by "REF", which is a count of the number of items (00-13) at
                  T2a-T2n for which T1 is checked "YES" but which R has
                  refused to give an amount. 


T2c         This should include income from tax-free bonds/mutual funds/money
            market funds.  If these are reported elsewhere in T2a-T2n, move
            them here to T2c, but only if clearly specified as 'tax-free'.


T2k         If R's housing is partially or fully subsidized by a governmental
            unit (learned from the TN or marginal notes), check T1n "YES" and
            write in 'SUBSIDIZED RENT'.  Enter the amount at T2n if it is
            known, NA if it is not.  If the rent subsidy is included in the
            amount given at T2k, move it to T1n if the amount is known.  If it
            can't be separated, code T2k as given and record on the Problem
            Sheet that Subsidized Rent is included.


T2n         1.    Move items listed at T2n that belong in T2a-T2m to their
                  proper location.  Move the types below to the locations
                  noted:

                  TYPE OF INCOME                   MOVE TO:

                  Net gain from sale of business. . . . . . T2f
                  Child care income . . . . . . . . . . . . T2a
                  U.S. Army VAQ (HOUSING ALLOWANCE) pay . . T2a
                  Jury duty pay . . . . . . . . . . . . . . T2a
                  Corporate Board of Directors fees . . . . T2a
                  Deferred compensation (from a job). . . . T2a

            2.    Edit out:   Tax refunds
                              Student Loans
                              Employer contributions to Pension Plans

            3.    Leave in T1n:  money from relatives
                                 IRA withdrawals


T3          Do not edit T3 for consistency with its components.  In general,
            T3 should not be edited at all (i.e., it should be kept as
            independent as possible from T2a-T2n) EXCEPT:

            1.    If T3 is missing (i.e., left blank), edit NA into the blank.

            2.    If R volunteers information in marginal notes at T3 which is
                  a codeable response or which must be added or subtracted
                  from the response given, you should edit it in.  E.g.,
                  "$25,000" (at T3) "and the commission I mentioned before"
                  (volunteered).  Otherwise, you should leave any codeable
                  response at T3 unedited.

                  a.    If R volunteers "just add it up", then just add it up
                        (i.e., sum T2a-T2n).

            3.    As indicated at T4-T4f below.


T4-T4f      If, in the process of responding to T4-T4f, R volunteers a
            codeable response for T3 (e.g., at T4b R states "more like
            $150,000" or T4f R volunteers "$24,000"), you should move the
            response to T3 and edit out the DK/REF box checked there.  



T6          1.    DO NOT edit out gifts or presents to others (including to
                  relatives and friends).  Thus, you would not edit out
                  "Christmas present to mother" and "We gave brother $2000 for
                  his birthday".

            2.    Edit charitable contributions to other than relatives and
                  friends to X10a.  Thus, "sent $40 per month to an orphan
                  child in Mexico" should be moved to X10a.

            3.    Also, edit out loans which it is clear are expected to be
                  repaid.  


T7          For R's recently divorced or separated, and not living with their
            spouse, check T7a-d to make sure they are edited as follows:

            1.    T7a must be checked "ALL OTHERS".

            2.    T7d should be only the AGI of the current PEU.  If it
                  includes the income of the separated/divorced spouse, or may
                  include it, leave T7d as is but write it on the Problem
                  Sheet.

            3.    If there is any indication that R and the divorced/separated
                  spouse filed their 1988 taxes jointly (i.e., box is checked
                  or marginal note says so), put this information on a Problem
                  Sheet.


                 SECTION X: CHARITY AND INTER-FAMILY TRANSFERS

X1-X8       Assets mentioned in Section X may match amounts listed in Section
            N or other places in the I'w.  Leave the double counting, since
            this section is concerned with the source of the asset.


X2          Edit the # OF INHERITANCES, TRUSTS, OTHER TRANSFERS entered in the
            box at X2 to be consistent with the number recorded in Columns #1-
            #3 and X8 as per GENERAL INSTRUCTION 24.


X2-X6       Edit out gifts or inheritances received by HU members other than R
            or Spouse, such as R's children or parents.  Write them on the
            Problem Sheet.


X5          If more than one date is given at X5, indicating more than one
            inheritance from the same source, leave the earliest and move the
            other(s) to the next columns, if they are available.  If there are
            no empty column(s) to edit them to, move them to the mop-up Q at
            X8.
        

X10         If R volunteered time (not money or property) and gave charitable
            contributions in that way, edit it out.


                      SECTION Y: RESPONDENT DEMOGRAPHICS

            GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ON DEMOGRAPHICS

Y7-Y23b     Edit these questions to agree with other information in the
            Interview and in the HHL box.  See the Editing Supervisor if you
            are unsure.  


Y5          If R mentions "children" in the Interview but none are in the HHL
            box and "NONE" is checked at Y5, see the Editing Supervisor.


Y7          Check the CHECKPOINT at Y7 for accuracy and make sure the
            appropriate sequence has been followed.

Y8e         For separated Rs:  This question should be consistent with the
            information reported in other sections.  If R reports, for
            example, assets are mostly 'OWNED BY R', edit all sections to
            reflect only the R's assets, debts, and income.  If they are
            'OWNED JOINTLY', make the sections consistent with this response. 
            If you have reason to believe the data do not reflect what the R
            reported in Y8e, take the interview to the Editing Supervisor.


Y8a, Y9a,   Edit "YEARS AGO" to "19___" by subtracting the number of "YEARS
Y10a, Y12,  AGO" from the date of Interview (89 or 90) and entering the result
Y12a        in the "19___" blank.  Then edit out the "YEARS AGO" response.


Y16         Check the CHECKPOINT at Y16 to agree with the HHL box and to make
            sure the appropriate sequence was followed.


Y13, Y22f   Edit "19___" to "AT ___ YEARS OLD" by subtracting the year entered
            in "19___" from the year of the Interview (89 or 90) and
            subtracting that result from R's imputed age (from the IMPUT AGE
            box for R on the facesheet).  Enter that result in the "AT ___
            YEARS OLD" blank and edit out the response in the "19___" blank.


Y25         Check the CHECKPOINT at Y25 to agree with the HHL box and to make
            sure the appropriate sequence has been followed.


Y25c&d      1.    Check each person listed here against the HHL for accuracy
                  of Relationship to Head (Y25c and HHL box A) and Age (Y25d
                  and HHL box C) to insure that each person listed here in
                  Y25c-Y25e can accurately be matched with the listing box.

            2.    Edit out anyone found in Y25c-Y25e who is not included in
                  the HHL listing box, or see the Editing Supervisor if it
                  seems that someone found here should have been listed.


Y33         Check the CHECKPOINT at Y33 to agree with the HHL box and to make
            sure the appropriate sequence has been followed.


Y34b        1.    If Y34b is checked "YES", edit the amount reported at Y34a
                  out of T2a-T2n and T3 (on pp. 102-103).  Then edit this
                  question (Y34b) from "YES" to "3" to indicate that the
                  information was double-counted but is now corrected.  

            2.    If it is unclear where or whether the amount at Y34b is
                  double-counted, see the Editing Supervisor and put the
                  information on the Problem Sheet.  If the amount is not
                  moved out of the income section, leave Y34b marked "YES".


Y35c        If Y35c is checked "YES", edit the amount at Y35b out of the
            income component (on p. 102) indicated by Y35a:

                  Y35a BOX                EDIT COMPONENT
                  CHECKED                 AT:             

                  A-C                     T2m, T3
                  D                       T2k, T3
                  E                       T2c/d, T3
                  F                       T2e, T3
                  G                       T2a/b, T3
                  H                       T2f/g, T3
                  J                       T2a-n, T3

            Then edit Y35c as per Y34b, item 1.


Y36b        If Y36b is checked "YES", check the vehicle grids at G8-G23d (pp.
            37-39) and G2b-G39d (pp. 41-43) and see if you can determine with
            assurance which of the vehicles there is the one whose value is
            specified at Y36a.  If you can, edit that vehicle out of the G
            section and edit this Q (Y36h) as per Y34b, item 1.

            If it is not clear which vehicle is specified, then do nothing and
            leave Y34b checked "YES".


Y37b        If Y37b is checked "YES" edit the amount reported at Y37a out of:

                  ACCOUNT                 
                  LOCATION                PAGE #

                  N5 & N8                 60, 61
                  N14                     63
                  N20 & N21a              64
                  N22b                    65
                  N25 & N26a              66, 67
                  N31a                    69

            and edit Y37b as per instruction for Y34b, item 1.

            If it is clear that the amount at Y37a is only part of the amount
            in the account (i.e., it is a joint account with a PEU member),
            edit out only the amount specified.  If, however, the amount is
            the whole account, then edit the account out, remembering to
            adjust the # of accounts at that location.


Y38b        If Y38c is checked "YES", edit the amount reported at Y38b (except
            for the amount which is reported at Y39b, if box A at Y38a is
            checked) out of the following locations depending on which boxes
            are checked at Y38a:

                  IF Y38a                 CHECK &ON
                  BOX                     EDIT     PAGE #

                  A                       (see instructions for Y39 below)

                  B                       N37, N39*70
                  C                       N32a, N33a-d69
                  D                       N28a-N28e*68
                  E                       N20   64
                  F                       M14*  54
                  G                       E18*  31
                  H                       (as needed)

                  * Other amounts are affected by editing these accounts;
                    see the Editing Supervisor. and then edit Y38c as per
                    instructions for Y34b (unless BOX A at Y38a is checked,
                    in which case you should leave Y38a "YES").


Y39         Check the CHECKPOINT at Y39 to agree with Y38a and to make sure
            the appropriate sequence has been followed.

            If "Rs HOME" is checked, see the Editing Supervisor.  Section D
            will have to be edited as per instructions for D27-D40a, note 3
            and D28, D29 & D31, item 1a.  The independent adults share will
            remain (also) at Y38b and Y39b-Y39c.  Y39b should equal D19 and
            Y39c should equal all the debts on the home.


Y42-Y43     CHECK FOR ACCURACY OF THESE CHECKPOINTS

            If R is covered by a pension on a current job, BOX 1 at Y42 should
            be checked;  if S is covered by a pension on a current job, BOX 4
            at Y43 should be checked.  If either of these are not consistent,
            bring to the Editing Supervisor.


Y43         NOTE:  The box labelled "R IS NOT MARRIED" at Y43 should be edited
            as though it reads "R IS NOT MARRIED/LIVING WITH PARTNER".


                            SECTION ZZ: OBSERVATION

ZZ2         CHECK TYPE OF STRUCTURE

            There should be just one box checked at ZZ2.  If more than one is
            checked, edit out all but one.  You can probably determine which
            is right by checking Section D.  If not, see Editing Supervisor.

                       Survey of Consumer Finance--1989

                          General Coding Instructions



1)    PERCENT VS. %:  Answers requiring the R to respond in a percentage will
      be coded in one of two ways.

      a)    Where answer line is labelled "PERCENT" (as at D4 on page 10), we
            will code a 3 digit whole per cent plus 2 decimal places (xxx.xx).

      b)    Where answer line is labelled "%" (as at D35 on page 19), we will
            code a 2 digit whole percent field plus 2 decimal places (xx.xx). 
            In these cases (usually asking interest rates being charged on
            loans) an answer of 10-3/4% will be coded 1075.

      c)    Conversion of fractional percentages into 2 decimal places:

                  1/4 = .25
                  1/2 = .50
                  3/4 = .75
                  1/8 = .13
                  3/8 = .37
                  5/8 = .63
                  7/8 = .87


2)    DOLLAR FIELDS:  Most $ fields are coded as 4 or 7 digit fields.  The
      four digit fields are indicated by a boxed precoded item (usually--as at
      D60 on page 25--9996.  No regular/usual payment or 9998.  DK) OR by a Q
      which specifically asks for a monthly payment.  All others which have no
      such indications are coded as 7 digits.  Please be especially careful of
      these large fields--it's very easy to miss-key in a value and the error
      may be very substantial.

      RANGE OF VALID CODES FOR DOLLAR FIELDS:  Please note that, due to the
      use of a "range card" (Card B) for DK answers to $ fields, the code
      values are as follows:

            1-(999)9979.
            (999)9979.  $(999)9979 or more -- This is the code to use when an
                                              actual amount is given by R
                                              which exceeds our field width.


      ANSWERS GIVEN FROM CARD B:

            (999)9980.  A.  LESS THAN $500
            (999)9981.  B.  $500-$1,000
            (999)9982.  C.  $1,001-$2,500
            (999)9983.  D.  $2,501-$10,000
            (999)9984.  E.  $10,001-$50,000
            (999)9985.  F.  $50,001-$250,000
            (999)9986.  G.  $250,001-$1 MILLION
            (999)9987.  H.  $1 MILLION-$10 MILLION
            (999)9988.  I.  $11 MILLION-$100 MILLION
            (999)9989.  J.  MORE THAN $100 MILLION

            (999)9996.  NONE; NO USUAL/REGULAR/TYPICAL PAYMENT 
                              (present at some locations) R only gives
                              assessed (home) value
            (999)9997.  OTHER/NEGATIVE AMOUNT; LOSS; amount in parens 
                              (present at some locations)
            (999)9998.  DK
            (999)9999.  NA

      In addition, there will be "warning" messages on several fields when
      large amounts are entered to try to clear up miss-punches as they occur.

3)    CODEBOOK JARGON:

            DK:    (Respondent answers) Don't Know
            NA:    Not Ascertained
            Inap.: Inappropriate (item or question)
            NFS:   Not further specified
            NEC:   Not elsewhere classified

4)    If MONTH is NA, but season is given, code:

            Winter = 02       Summer = 08       Spring = 05       Fall = 11
      
5)    For all Q's asking "# of years", code "01" will include one year or less
      but will not include "NONE".

6)    RESTRICTED AMOUNT CODES:  Whenever the full range of numbers is not
      available for an item (example V5, Length of Iw:  the current valid
      range is 15-240 minutes only), make a card for any amount falling
      outside the valid range.
      Never assume an "XX or more" unless it is printed at the particular
      location.

7)    If an answer exceeds the valid range specified in the codebook, make
      a card and put on Joan's desk.  Example: # of vehicles range is (01-25). 
      If R says "32" we will adjust the valid range.

8)    Tab items as you choose, but do not remove pages -- get a xerox if you
      want copies of codes to keep out of the codebook.

                   PANEL PRE-EDIT INSTRUCTIONS


The purpose of the 1989 SCF Panel Study Pre-edit is to assure
that the household listing data is as complete and accurate as
possible.  The procedures involve correcting inconsistencies
which exist in the identifying information of the Respondent,
his/her Spouse, or of other household members, based on
comparisons of the '89 listings to the '83 and '86 household
member listings as they appear on the 1989 SCF Panel "HOUSEHOLD
LISTING UPDATE" (HHL) sheet.


The purpose of the first part of the pre-edit is to examine all
HHL UPDATE sheets in order to identify cases where discrepancies
exist from one time period to the next and where household
members cannot be tracked with certainty.  


The second part of the pre-edit procedures consists of looking up
additional information for problem cases to clear up and correct
cases that can be explained by normal changes in household
membership such as children leaving or returning home, re-
marriage of the Respondent, or by errors in age/sex information.


The third part of the pre-edit handles correction of the more
difficult problem cases -- those that do not have an explanation
after looking at the available information and that may require
staff decisions to change data to create consistency between time
periods.


MARKING CORRECTIONS:  

     a.   Corrections to the HHL UPDATE sheet should be marked in
          green with bad data crossed out and the corrected data
          written in next to it.

     b.   Any corrections to the '83 and '86 listings on the
          FRONT of the HHL UPDATE sheet will later need to be
          recorded on the actual coversheets.  To facilitate
          this, XEROX the FRONT of the sheet, circle the changes
          in green, and file the sheets in the folder marked
          "COVERSHEET CHANGES".

     c.   Corrections to other '83 or '86 data should be marked
          on the "Data Listing Sheet" in green.  

     d.   Corrections to data in the '89 interview form should be
          done by circling out bad information and putting in
          changes in red; these must be initialed by study staff.


PART 1: Routine Interview Checks

1.   Check that there is a HOUSEHOLD LISTING UPDATE sheet in each
     interview.  If there isn't, circle the Case number on the
     "Sample ID Printout" and inform the Editing Supervisor.

     NOTE:  If 2 listing sheets are found in one case, pull out
     the blank one (with no Iwer handwriting) and place it in the
     "Extra Listing Sheets" folder.

2.   Verify that each case has its correct sheet by checking the
     Sample ID.  Write the 1989 ID (3000 or 4000 sequence) in the
     upper left-hand corner of the UPDATE sheet if it is missing.

3.   On the BACK, calculate the current ages of all listed
     household members, using birthdate in column (f), and (if
     needed) date in Interview on the facesheet.  Cross out the
     printed age in Column (d) and write the current age on the
     right-hand edge of Column (b) for each person.  (See Example
     #1)

     If birthdate is missing for R or S, look it up on the "Data
     Listing Sheets".

4.   Trace each household member who appears on any of the  
     listings, checking age and sex information for consistency. 

     Age will be allowed to increase by 2 - 4 years from '83 to
     '86 and from '86 to '89, and by 5 - 7 years from '83 to '89
     without being considered a problem.  However, if you are
     certain that a listed age was inaccurate, cross out the
     wrong age and write in the correct age next to it.

          ***************************************************
          *  To help in calculating ages, the interview     *
          *  periods for the three studies are as follows:  *
          *                                                 *
          *         1983:   February - August '83           *
          *         1986:   June - September '86            *
          *         1989:   October '89 - March '90         *
          ***************************************************
     The actual dates of interview are printed on the HHL sheets.

5.   Look at columns 'g' and 'h' on the BACK of sheet, top grid,
     and Column 'h' in the 'Mover In' (bottom) grid.  Check that
     the dates given for household members coming and going is
     consistent with the listings at each time point.  A number
     of differences are expected to turn up here.  (See Example
     #2)

6.   Where children's ages vary from time point to time point,
     check page 121 of the '89 interview or the "'83 - '86 Data
     Listing Sheets" book for that case to see if the situation
     is explainable by different children being there at
     different times.  The rule of thumb for deciding a case is
     O.K. is:  If the recorded information is consistent with a
     plausible explanation, then no further look-ups need to be
     done.

     95.  Persons deleted from '83 list.
     96.  No listing sheet found;  made up by Editing Supervisor.
     97.  Other combination or corrections, not specified above.



9.   For cases where everything is all right -- for example, the only
     problems are that either the ages are off within the limits
     specified above, or that children's age differences are
     explainable by their being different children, -- such cases may
     be refiled.  All other cases should be set aside as problem
     cases.

PART 2: HANDLING THE PROBLEM CASES.

1.   Look up any information in the current (1989) interview that
     might clear up the problem.  Helpful places to look are Y6 - Y12
     (pp 122-132) or YY1 - YY7 (pp 133-140) for marital history, Y16
     for spouse marital history, and Y1 for children living elsewhere.
     

2.   Look up remaining cases in the data listings.  See if the problem
     is explainable or correctable from looking at all the information
     available -- e.g. marital history, ages of children living
     elsewhere.  

3.   If corrections need to be made to the data or the coversheet,
     follow the procedures outlined below for noting them.

4.   On a "yellow sticky", write up a description of each problem
     case, noting what additional information is needed, and place
     this on the face sheet of the interview;  insert  HH Listing
     update in the interview.  Sort the problem interviews into piles
     of similar kinds of problems.



PART 3:   FURTHER LOOK-UPS.

1.   Additional information may be needed on cases that still remain
     as problems.  Possible sources are the '83/'86 coversheets, or
     the '83/'86 interviews themselves.  

2.   If none of the information available provides an answer to the
     problem of a particular case, that interview should be set aside
     in a special pile with all its associated material;  these will
     be resolved by the study staff and the Feds.

                       89 SCF EDITING ADDENDUM FOR PANEL

HOUSEHOLD LISTING UPDATE SHEET:

It is crucial that these are carefully edited and checked to eliminate
problems down the road.  

      1.    Do not do the computed and imputed ages on the face-sheet;  this
            will be handled by the pre-edit being done on the 'HOUSEHOLD
            LISTING UPDATE SHEET'.

      2.    Do the "ABSENT  SPOUSE PRE-CODE" (v100 = ____) as before if the
            spouse is absent.  Write it next to the Sample ID on the BACK of
            the HHL UPDATE sheet.

      3.    Check over the HHL UPDATE sheet and read through the Thumbnail and
            interviewer notes to see that everything looks consistent; confirm
            that the designated R on the HHL update (top grid on the back) is
            the R that was actually interviewed AND is in Section R of the Iw. 
            If you have any suspicions about the listing, see the Editing
            Supervisor.

      4.    If the '89 R and Spouse have been reversed from the '83 R and
            Spouse, this must be corrected on the HHL Update sheet because the
            person interviewed as the R in '83 must be listed on line 1 of the
            household listing box, (Item 8 on the HHL Update sheet) if that
            person was in the household in '89.  In addition, the interview
            must be edited for these cases so that the data specified as data
            for "R" is the data for the person listed on line 1 -- the '83 R. 
            

            Therefore, any time you find a case where you have the slightest
            suspicion that the '89 Resp and Spouse have been reversed from
            '83, or that the '89 Respondent is not the same person as the '83
            Respondent, you must take it to the Editing Supervisor for Pre-
            Editing.  She will consult the '83 coversheet to verify who the
            actual '83 Respondent was, will make corrections as needed in red
            on the HHL Update sheet, and return the interview to you.  When
            you receive the interview back, you will follow one of two
            possible courses of action.  

            A.    If the R and Spouse have not been switched, you can proceed
                  to edit the interview in a normal manner.

            B.    If, however, the R and Spouse have been reversed, then you
                  must check the data at all locations specified below to
                  assure that it is consistent with this change.  The
                  following data locations need to be corrected:

                  1)    M9b and N11

                  2)    IN THE SPOUSE BOOKLET:
                        a.    Carefully remove p. 14a.
                        b.    If S1c or S1f is checked "NO", change the Skip
                              Instruction to "S47".
                        c.    If S44 is checked "FULL-TIME", cross out the
                              Skip Instruction.
                        d.    If S44 is checked "PART-TIME", change the Skip
                              Instruction (S.I.) to "S46".

                        IN THE R SECTION:
                        a.    Staple p.14a (from the Spouse Booklet) over p.
                              91.
                        b.    If R1c or R1f is checked "NO", change the S.I.
                              to "S44c" and check the correct S44c box on P.
                              14a.
                        c.    If R44 is checked "FULL-TIME", change the S.I.
                              to "S44a" and check the correct S44a box on P.
                              14a.
                        d.    If R44 is checked "PART-TIME", change the S.I.
                              to "S44b" and check the correct S44b box on P.
                              14a.
                        e.    On p. 14a:  Delete the box the Interviewer had
                              checked if it is different from the new box you
                              checked.

                  3)    R50c-f, R51b (recipient), R52b, R53e, T7b (boxes 3 and
                        4)

                  4)    V16 - V17k must be switched with V19 - V19m

                  5)    V26a

                  6)    Demographics in Section Y:
                        Resp                    Spouse
                        Y2-Y3b,Y5    with       Y18 - Y21

                  7)    Checkpoint at Y6 must be checked and corrected if
                        wrong.

                  8)    Y25a (health conditions), Y29d, Y31, Y31c,

                  9)    The checkboxes at Y42 and Y43 need to be fixed to
                        correspond to the corrected R and S.

     5.    Precode Item 1 on the FRONT of the sheet.  Underline the correct
            code if marked, or mark the correct code if it is incorrectly
            marked.  If R says he/she is married, but the spouse does not live
            in the household, code use codes '7' or '8' as on the Cross-
            section to indicate the spouse is not in the house.

      6.    Precode Marital Status for everyone currently in the household
            using Column (e) to write the code.  Enter the numbers 1-6
            (corresponding to the numbers at Item 1) plus '7' and '8' (for the
            Respondent only).  Code Marital Status for all HH members 18 and
            older for whom there is some indication what their status is.  For
            young adults who were in the household in both '83 and '86 and are
            now age 20-22, assume 'Never Married' (code '6').  For any person
            under 18, leave blank unless marital status is known. (These will
            be coded '6' by machine.)  For others, if no indication, code '9'.

      7.    Code Column (g) for everyone in the listing {including 'Movers
            In'-- mark to the left of the lined dividing columns (f) and (h)}
            using the "RESIDENT STATUS CODE" from the Cross-section with the
            following revisions:

            Code:
                  5.    NO is marked, and a DATE LEFT must be indicated.  If
                        none is listed, code 99/99 in column (h).

                  6.    A "mover in" who is assumed to live there all the
                        time;  no other notes are given.  

                  7.    A "mover in" for whom there is some indication that
                        they do not live there all the time.  Check the HHL
                        UPDATE sheet and the Thumbnail.

      8.    Code the "economic units" as for the Cross-section.  There may be
            less consistency in the marking of these, since a number of new
            interviewers started working on the study when the Panel portion
            began.

            All movers out should be coded "0" here.


R: RESPONDENT EMPLOYMENT

R1e:  Edit any hourly wages to dollars per week using full-time hours which is
40 hours/wk for males and 35 hours/wk for females.  Use the '8' code to show a
conversion was done.

In cases where the information recorded in this section is for the person that
was the '83 Spouse, write in BIG RED LETTERS "CODE FOR SPOUSE".   

R45-R47u    This section is different from the Cross
S45-S47u    section in that it asks about the job R had in 1983 and then
            updates work history only for the past 3 years (36 months).  Not
            much to do here that the computer can't do with more ease.



S: SPOUSE BOOKLET

The Spouse booklet is the same as for the Cross-section except for (1) the
checkpoints at S44a - S44c on page 14a
and (2) the work history section has 2 possible routes through it -- the 'S'
questions for updating old spouse work history, and the 'SS' questions for
Spouses that are new to the R's household.  The checkpoints S14a-S14c direct
the R to the correct sequence.

In cases where the information recorded in this section is for the person that
was the '83 Respondent write in BIG RED LETTERS "CODE FOR RESPONDENT", and see
Editing Supervisor.  

In the some copies of the questionnaire, new Questions S14a-S14c have been
stapled onto the page to correct for erroneous checkpoints.  A copy of the
corrected page is attached; see Editing Supervisor if the replacement page was
not stapled in.



T: INCOME QUESTIONS 


T8,T10      1.    Make all figures annual, as you have been doing    on the
                  Cross-section.

                  If R states the amounts for '86 or '87 income were "a little
                  less than now" or some other explanation indicating that
                  there have only been cost of living or inflation
                  adjustments, and no dollar amount is given, code the amount
                  as equal to the known amount.

T8-T15            Amounts given in these questions should include the income
                  and support of all persons living in the household at that
                  time.  So for currently divorced persons, income of their
                  ex-spouses should be included.

T9,T11            Look over the 'Refused' sequence, to see that it makes
                  sense.  If unclear, see Editing Supervisor.



V: CHANGES IN FAMILY FINANCES

This section did not appear in the Cross-section version of the questionnaire. 
In general, you should leave information as given;  do not check for
consistencies with earlier sections except as specified below.

This section should refer to persons in the HU, and not just to those in the
Primary Economic Unit, since PEU was not a concept applied to the
questionnaire in the 1983 survey.

V1-V2 Check for gross inconsistencies with the D Section.  Bring them to the
      Editing Supervisor if you find any.


V20   1.    If V20 = '1. YES', check that someone actually left the household
            since 1983.  

      2.    Code V20 as follows:

            If there is an inconsistency between the V20 report and the
            listing update, code V20 "3" If the reports are consistent,
            underline the "1. YES" box.  If the "5. NO" box is checked,
            underline it.


V22   1.    If V22 = '1. YES', check that someone other than a new spouse
            joined the household since 1983.

      2.    Code V22 as follows:

            If there is an inconsistency between the V22 report and the
            listing update, code V22 "3" If the reports are consistent,
            underline the "1. YES" box.  If the "5. NO" box is checked,
            underline it.


V33         If an inheritance is already mentioned at X3-X6, delete from here
            and leave in Section X.


Y: DEMOGRAPHICS

The questions in the Y section are similar to the questions in the Cross-
section version of the questionnaire, but the layout is somewhat different. 
Respondents go through either the Y7 - Y12f sequence if they were interviewed
in 1986, or they go through the YY1 - YY8 sequence if they were not
interviewed in 1986.

Look for inconsistencies in the marital history and marital status questions
that may be indicative of other, more serious problems.  If the information is
inconsistent, see the Editing Supervisor.

Verify these checkpoints using the HHL UPDATE sheet:

Y6,Y6a,     
Y6b,Y10b,
Y11b,Y12b

YY1,YY3h,YY4h,YY6c,

                    1989 Survey of Consumer Finances--Panel

                        Occupation Coding Instructions


NOTE: The instructions for current job refer only to R, but they also apply to
      Spouse.


Section M:

      1.    Code any business listed at M5a, then check M9b (P.52) to see if R
            works in the business; you may need this when editing/coding
            Section R.

      2.    If an M5a business is listed as R's current job in Section R, use
            M5a information as an aid to coding industry at R5/R14a (the
            information at M5a is often better than that in Section R).


Section R:

      1.    R1 Status:  If the only combination checked is RETIRED and
            DISABLED, check P.1 Listing Box for R's age.  If 62 or older, code
            as RETIRED; if under 62, code as DISABLED.

      2.    R2:  If SOMEONE ELSE is checked, and the industry given at R5 is
            clearly an M5a business in which R works (M9b), write in "M5a"
            under the "IF R SAYS" box at R2.

      3.    R14/R14a (SELF-EMPLOYED):  If the industry given is clearly an M5a
            business in which R works (M9b), make sure box to right of R14 is
            checked; if not, mark it.  

      4.    In combinatiuon with anything except worker (code 15), HOUSEWIFE
            is low priority.

      5.    Other examples of resolving multiple checks at R1:

            a.  WORKING + STUDENT + UNEMPLOYED = 14 (worker and student)

            b.  UNEMPLOYED + STUDENT + HOMEMAKER = 30 (unemployed)


                       Occupation and Industry Locations


Key to Codes:     OCC = 1970 Census 3-digit occupation code
                  IND = 1970 Census 3-digit industry code
                  SUM = 2-digit occupation summary code
                  SPI = Special 2-digit industry code (M5a only)
